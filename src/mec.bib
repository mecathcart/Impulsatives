	Abstract = {CP arguments have been argued to be Caseless and u-featureless. Empirical
evidence mainly drawn from Spanish suggests that this claim should be reconsidered.
In this paper, I claim that clausal arguments and nominalized clauses have a u content
and Case specification. These types of arguments are therefore able to relate by
agreement with a functional category. The facts examined support minimalist
guidelines by claiming that the concrete realization of the u and Case content of a
syntactic object is irrelevant for computational mechanisms to take place.},

@article{Goria:2002,
	Abstract = {Central to this paper is the relation, in Piedmontese, between verbinterrogative
clitic inversion and main wh-questions introduced by the
complementizer che (wh+che). Parry (1998a) takes these structures to be in
complementary distribution, claiming that che preempts V-to-C movement in
interrogative inversion and destroys the licensing environment for interrogative
clitics. In this paper, I argue for the revision of this claim. Building on Chomsky's
(1995) checking theory, I propose an analysis of Piedmontese interrogatives in the
spirit of Roberts and Roussou's (1999) dissociation of features [wh] and [Q]. I
maintain that interrogative V-to-C movement and matrix wh+che questions target
different CPs, hence the verb in C and che do not compete for the same position.
Factors other than syntactic ones are responsible for the rare use of interrogative clitics
in wh+che structures. The analysis presented in this paper supports the complexity of
the Left Periphery proposed by Rizzi (1997).},

to compare restructured predicates with nonrestructured ones, keeping

As such, it does not interact with the Case Filter, which is argued to be a purely syntactic constraint as opposed to a morphophonological one. It is shown that diverse phenomena in the distribution of pronouns in English can be parsimoniously treated using default case, and further that English can thereby be assimilated to ``richer'' case languages such as German, rather than being analyzed with arbitrary language-particular rules. A sampling of phenomena from other languages demonstrates that evidence for default case is widespread, and moreover, that crosslinguistic differences in case patterns can often be reduced to the choice of a default case.},

complex ways that are still not well understood. Third, the movement theory of

for the theory of control. Traditionally, Case has been identified as the key to this
problem: PRO was argued to bear no Case at all, or some special (  null  ) Case. I argue
that PRO bears standard case like normal lexical DPs; clear evidence comes from
languages with case-concord (Russian, Hungarian, Icelandic). Moreover, PRO (and
obligatory control) may occur in finite clauses (Hebrew, Balkan languages).
Conclusion: PRO's distribution must be completely divorced from Case, possibly
because abstract Case does not exist. The alternative is to tie the distribution of PRO
to the specific values of [T] and [Agr] on the I0 and C0 heads of the embedded
clause (Landau 2004). A feature-based algorithm predicts the distribution of PRO in a
variety of clausal complements. It is shown that the system naturally explains some
intriguing correlations between obligatory control and agreement in Basque and Welsh

	Abstract = {Historically, control in generative grammar has fallen within the province of
syntactic theory. One primary reason for this is that Mainstream Generative Grammar
(MGG) has imposed a strong uniformity criterion on analyses as a measure of their
explanatory adequacy. One aspect of this uniformity criterion, which we call Interface
Uniformity, holds that the syntax-semantics interface is maximally simple, in that meaning
maps transparently into syntactic structure, and that it is maximally uniform, so that the
same meaning always maps into the same syntactic structure. It follows from Interface
Uniformity that a nonfinite VP has a syntactic subject that is assigned its external h-role.
We argue that this view is most sustainable if one does not take into account the full richness
and complexity of control phenomena, but treats control strictly in terms of complementation.
When a fuller range of phenomena is taken into account, it appears that it is preferable to
``turn over control'' to the semantics, which is better equipped to capture the facts.We outline
how to formulate the syntax-semantics interface so as to get the semantic facts to line up
properly with the syntactic facts. This analysis of the interface extends naturally to raising.},

	Abstract = {Theories of indefinites vary with respect to whether these noun phrases can be treated as quantificational. Although everyone seems to be in agreement that indefinites do not always introduce their own quantificational force, there is widespread disagreement as to whether they ever do. In this article, we present experimental evidence from children learning English and Kannada demonstrating that children's indefinites show scopal restrictions parallel to the restrictions they show with other unambiguously quantificational expressions. Children, unlike adults, show a strong preference to assign quantificational expressions surface scope. This is true for both strong and weak quantifiers, which would be surprising on a theory of indefinites that treated these expressions as uniformly nonquantificational. Consequently, we argue that in adult grammars indefinites must have a quantificational representation at least some of the time.},

	Abstract = {This article addresses general questions about the organization of grammar via a detailed discussion
of a small, but well-explored, area of English: the contraction of want to to wanna. It
distinguishes three general approaches to the analysis of wanna: a phonological rule, lexicalization,
or a derivational rule. Each approach has a different set of strengths, but they all have weaknesses
as well. The article then offers a new analysis in terms of REALIZATION, which combines the
strengths of all the previous analyses. This analysis, which is based on the theory of word grammar,
accounts not only for all the well-known syntactic and morphological constraints on this contraction,
but also for a fact that has not been noted before: that, for some speakers, the last vowel
alternates in just the same idiosyncratic way as that of to, which suggests strongly that in some
sense wanna contains to as well as want. For these (but not all) speakers, the proposed analysis
recognizes two words (sublexemes of WANT and TOinf) at the level of syntax and a single form
( wanna , containing variants of  want  and  to ) at the level of form; the relations between these
words and forms, and between the forms and their phonological realizations, are defined by a
declarative network.},

@article{Giannakidou:2006,
	Abstract = {The main focus of this article is the occurrence of some polarity items (PIs) in the complements
of emotive factive verbs and only. This fact has been taken as a challenge to the semantic approach
to PIs (Linebarger 1980), because only and factive verbs are not downward entailing (DE). A
modification of the classical DE account is proposed by introducing the notion of nonveridicality
(Zwarts 1995, Giannakidou 1998, 1999, 2001) as the one crucial for PI sanctioning. To motivate
this move, it is first shown that two solutions in the direction of weakening classical monotonicity
do not work: Strawson DE (von Fintel 1999) and weak DE (Hoeksema 1986). Weakening DE
systematically either overgenerates or undergenerates, in either case failing to characterize the
correct set of licensers. Nonveridicality is introduced as a conservative extension of DE and is
shown to account for PIs also in contexts that are not DE (i.e. questions, modal verbs, imperatives,
directive propositional attitudes). This theory, augmented with the premise that certain PIs (i.e.
the liberal class represented by any) are subject to a weaker polarity dependency identified not
as LICENSING but as RESCUING by nonveridicality, explains the occurrence of this particular class
with only and emotive factive verbs. Crosslinguistic comparisons illustrate that the occurrence
of PIs with only and emotive factives is not a general phenomenon, and further support the dual
nature of polarity dependency and the semantic characterization of the elements that license or
rescue PIs.},

for this hypothesis. In Japanese loanword phonology, a voiced geminate, but not a singleton,
devoices to dissimilate from another voiced obstruent within a single stem. Based on this observation,
I argue that the [ voice] feature is protected by two different faithfulness constraints,
IDENT( voi)Sing and IDENT( voi)Gem, and they are ranked as IDENT( voi)Sing >> IDENT( voi)Gem

	Abstract = {A key mechanism in the organization of turns at talk in conversation is the ability to anticipate
or PROJECT the moment of completion of a current speaker's turn. Some authors suggest that this
is achieved via lexicosyntactic cues, while others argue that projection is based on intonational
contours. We tested these hypotheses in an on-line experiment, manipulating the presence of
symbolic (lexicosyntactic) content and intonational contour of utterances recorded in natural conversations.
When hearing the original recordings, subjects can anticipate turn endings with the
same degree of accuracy attested in real conversation. With intonational contour entirely removed
(leaving intact words and syntax, with a completely flat pitch), there is no change in subjects'
accuracy of end-of-turn projection. But in the opposite case (with original intonational contour
intact, but with no recognizable words), subjects' performance deteriorates significantly. These
results establish that the symbolic (i.e. lexicosyntactic) content of an utterance is necessary (and
possibly sufficient) for projecting the moment of its completion, and thus for regulating conversational
turn-taking. By contrast, and perhaps surprisingly, intonational contour is neither necessary
nor sufficient for end-of-turn projection.},

degree constructions (obligatory extraposition effects and scope rigidity
effects determined by the superficial position of degree phrases/

Fox and Nissenbaum's (1999) analysis of extraposition in conjunction
with the nonconservativity of (certain) degree words. We show that,
under full preservation of Bhatt and Pancheva's theoretical assumptions,
their account faces at least three problems: (a) one of the phenomena
they propose to unify, the one involving scope effects, does not
exist; (b) (non)conservativity is irrelevant to obligatory extraposition
effects; and (c) contrary to their tacit assumption, Trace Conversion
is at most an optional procedure for DegP chains.
We propose an alternative, nonsemantic treatment of obligatory
extraposition effects, which subsumes them under an independently
needed adjacency constraint on prehead modifiers. Furthermore, we
note that the facts brought up here and in Bhatt and Pancheva 2004
call into question the quantificational approach to degree constructions.},

model demonstrates that the analysis gives the correct forms for the majority of nouns in a basic

depends on recognizing two different types of default: NORMAL CASE DEFAULT, the expected outcome

@article{Padgett:2002,
	Abstract = {This article argues for a particular understanding of feature class behavior---the recurrent patterning
together of certain phonological features, such as place of articulation and laryngeal
features. The proposals build on the well-known work of feature geometry in assuming the importance
of feature classes in phonology, but differ in that features of a class are targeted directly
and individually by constraints (or rules), even when a feature class such as Place is mentioned.
Further, constraints mentioning feature classes are gradiently violable. Evidence for this view of
feature classes comes from two sources. First, assimilation involving feature classes is sometimes
only partially successful; an adequate understanding of such cases requires the proposed view of
feature classes. Second, there are broad categories of feature class generalization that require it,
including dissimilatory effects usually handled by the obligatory contour principle. Overall, the
proposals broaden the explanatory potential of the feature class idea due to feature geometry. At
a more general level, the results here suggest that linguistic representations sometimes need to
be reconsidered in the context of optimality theory (Prince & Smolensky 1993), since they can
effectively function as inviolable constraints and so hinder our understanding of the more subtle
kind of phenomena revealed by analyses employing gradiently violable constraints.},

syllables into groups that are phonetically most distinct from each other. Phonologically complex
distinctions are those which exceed an upper threshold in the number of phonological predicates
to which they refer. It is claimed that languages adopt weight distinctions that are phoneticallymost
effective without being overly complex phonologically. Syllableweight thus reflects a compromise
between phonetic and phonologicalfactors. The proposed modelof weight further suggests that
phonological weight distinctions are ultimately predictable from other basic phonological properties,

suggests this, and left-to-right asymmetric c-command among internal arguments of SVCs confirms
it. The anomaly is universal among surface right-headed languages with SVCs, indicating
that deep left-headedness is universal, as antisymmetry theory predicts (Kayne 1994). Assuming
complements are in Specs, and that a light verb v selects every VP (Chomsky 1999), I derive
VOVO from OVOV by two instances of V-to-v movement. I argue for a nonuniform approach
to SVCs, involving relations of both raising (Campbell 1989) and control (Collins 1997). Other
aspects of SVC word order are predictable from a universal thematic hierarchy nontheme  
theme, and short scrambling (Takano 1998).},

@article{Tiersma:2002,
	Abstract = {It is becoming increasingly common for linguists to testify as expert witnesses in both civil
and criminal trials. Often linguistic expertise is clearly helpful to the judge or jury. Based on
published judicial opinions, from which we draw our data, it appears that courts have allowed
linguists to testify on such issues as the probable origin of a speaker, the comprehensibility of a
text, whether a particular defendant understood the Miranda warning, and the phonetic similarity
of two competing trademarks. In other areas the admissibility of linguistic testimony has been
more controversial, including author and speaker identification, discourse analysis, the meaning
of legal texts, and the comprehensibility of jury instructions. Reasons for judicial reluctance to

	Abstract = {While a consensus has been reached about the monoclausality of the Romance construction
with an auxiliary verb and its verbal complement, questions remain about its syntactic structure.
We focus here on French auxiliaries---the past tense auxiliaries (avoir and e?tre), and the passive
auxiliary (e?tre)---which are unique in French in contributing only tense and aspect and triggering
obligatory clitic climbing. Three syntactic structures have been proposed for such auxiliaries: a
VP complement analysis, a verbal complex analysis, and a `flat' VP analysis. We show here,
working within a HEAD-DRIVEN PHRASE STRUCTURE GRAMMAR framework and basing our arguments
on classical constituency tests, bounded dependencies, and lesser-known properties of a subset
of manner adverbs, that the flat-structure analysis is to be preferred for tense auxiliaries, which
take as their complements the bare participle as well as the complements subcategorized by this
participle and `inherited' from it. In contrast, the passive auxiliary, which we identify with the
copula, has a predicative complement with different realizations: either an ordinary phrase, `saturated'
for its complements, or a `partial' complement, where the predicative head lets some or
all of its complements be inherited by the auxiliary. Our analysis allows for a solution to the
well-known problem of auxiliary selection, which, we argue, should not be taken as an indicator
of syntactic structure but is best handled via lexical constraints.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a semantic analysis of several contrasting properties between the
Spanish plural existential determiners unos `a-pl.' and algunos `some-pl.' is presented
within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT). Some of
these properties can be directly related to the distinction between the thetic and
the categorical judgment, as understood by Kuroda and Ladusaw. Others, related
to plurality and the interaction of quantifiers, provide evidence for an extension of
the scope of the distinction and its implementation as a procedural semantic difference.
It will be argued that the determiner unos contributes a group discourse
referent to a Discourse Representation Structure (DRS). This discourse referent is
subject to a no linking constraint, and does not trigger box-splitting of the DRS.
This forms the basis for the claim that this plural determiner participates only in
thetic judgments. On the other hand, the determiner algunos is not subject to a no
linking constraint and may contribute a duplex condition to the DRS. Thus, it can
participate in categorical judgments. This type of judgment corresponds to a set of
construction rules which yields an updated DRS in which a new discourse referent
has been introduced and, in contrast to the thetic judgment, a linking condition
and a duplex condition are introduced. The analysis is extended to account for
the effects of contrastive focus and scopal interactions with other operators in the
semantics of Spanish existential determiners.},

mood morphology conveys information about model flow in discourse,

certain type of verbs, namely, `telic' verbs. In line with this observation we propose
that aspect is a crucial feature of these sequences projecting whenever one of
these verbs is selected and providing a landing site for object movement. Another
part of the analysis of the OV constructions implies noticing that the morphological
make-up of the verbal elements is not always non-finite. The alternation that
we observe between VO-OV constructions seems to be determined by the verb type
but it is only fully accounted for if we allow for a framework in which the AGR
parameter is not yet set. This possibility follows from the bilingualism proposal
in Roeper (1999) where child language permits different grammars to co-exist in
a particular stage. In the case under consideration the AGR feature would be
allowed to have two values and thus the verb would not raise obligatorily.},

dream, focusing on Italian data. The relevance of these contexts is twofold: on
the one hand, they exhibit very consistent behaviour across Romance languages
with respect to mood selection, in that they always select the indicative in their
complement clause, rejecting the subjunctive. On the other hand, their interpretive
properties change according to the tense used: when containing a subordinate
imperfect indicative tense, dream reports have the property that the dreamed
eventuality need not be temporally anchored; at the same time, they do not seem
to ascribe any specific attitude to the subject (the dreamer). When containing a
non-imperfect indicative tense, temporal anchoring is available, and a particular
evidential meaning can be detected, revealing the presence of a speaker-oriented
attitude towards the content of the dream. The connection between temporal anchoring
and the presence/absence of a propositional attitude will be investigated:
semantically, within an extensional, truth-theoretical framework by arguing in
favour of a reflexive/tensed-thoughts approach to propositional attitudes; and in
its morphosyntactic aspects, by motivating a conception according to which the
interaction between the temporal features of T and the features of C provide the

@article{Bernstein:2001,
	Abstract = {This article examines constructions involving DP-final demonstratives, possessive
adjectives, indefinite quantifiers, and demonstrative reinforcers in several Romance
languages. Across these languages the DP-final position of these elements
yields a focus interpretation, whereas the prenominal position yields a neutral interpretation.
Other approaches to these sorts of facts have (tacitly) treated the
two available word orders as equivalent constructions. They have not considered,
and so cannot easily account for, the distinct interpretation that each of the word
orders yields. Under the assumption that the prenominal position of these elements
is basic, the current approach develops the idea that the DP-final element is
``stranded'' DP finally as a result of the leftward movement of a syntactic phrase
consisting of an extended NP. The facts examined here recall those characterizing
the expression of focus in the Romance clause, recently analyzed as a case
of scrambling (Ord{\'o}{\~n}ez 1997, Zubizarreta 1998). If on the right track, the current
analysis therefore provides further evidence for the parallelism between noun
phrases and clauses. In certain Romance languages, an intermediate (postnominal)
position is also available for these DP elements , although the interpretation
associated with this position does not exactly match that of either the prenominal
or DP-final position. It is proposed that the intermediate position is derived
by crossing the noun over the demonstrative (reinforcer), possessive, or indefinite
quantifier, whose base positions within DP are relatively high. The prediction then
is that only those languages with robust noun movement (that is, movement to a
relatively high functional head) will exhibit this word order.},

@article{Anderson:2004a,
	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with (some of) the evidence for analogies in
structure between phonology and syntax, and with (some of) the evidence for the
basis for limitations on analogy. The first half of the paper ({\S}{\S}1--3) looks at
syllable structure with a view to determining what aspects of syllable structure are
contrastive, so basic. It is concluded that, particularly given the need to satisfy
sonority, linearity within the syllable is minimally- or non-contrastive, but that
the head-based structural relations of complementation and adjunction may be
contrastive. {\S}4 argues indeed that phonological (and specifically syllabic) structure
displays the same distinctions among complement, adjunct and specifier that is
evident in the syntax, and indicates that this analogy is not an isolated case by
pointing to a further one involving harmony, a familiar notion from the
phonology that can be applied to syntactic phenomena such as  sequence of
tenses . The paper concludes ({\S}5) with a brief survey of factors limiting structural
analogy. These all have to do with the demands of the interfaces of the linguistic
with the extra-linguistic: on the one hand, the need for the syntax to represent
complex cognitively-based scenes; on the other, the restrictions imposed by the
phoneticity of phonology, particularly the requirements of sonority discussed
initially.},

concept of sonority in such non-linear approaches to phonology that make use of
both the segmental tier and the skeletal tier. I will argue that these approaches
are forced to take the skeletal tier as the relevant level for the application of
sonority. However, since long vowels occupy two positions on this tier, they form
a sonority plateau, a configuration that is generally forbidden by basic sonority
constraints. To solve this inconsistency, I will propose the concept of segments
with inherently falling sonority. In addition, I will consider other candidates for
elements with inherently uneven sonority. The intricacies of sonority will be
discussed considering German as an example, following the assumption that
phonological concepts, despite having a universal core, are characterised by
language-specific adjustments.},

	Abstract = {English Pseudogapping constructions share some surface similarities
with both Gapping and Verb Phrase Ellipsis (VPE). Levin (1978, 1979 [main text])
concludes, however, that Pseudogapping is transformationally unrelated to both
Gapping and VPE. We argue that this conclusion is only partially correct.
Gapping and Pseudogapping are transformationally related in that they both
involve the application of verb movement, in particular sideward movement of
the main verb. We take Johnson's (1994) ATB Movement analysis of Gapping as
an important precedent in this regard, and we draw from proposals of Nunes
(2001) and Nunes and Uriagereka (2000) for the possibility of sideward
movement out of coordinate structures and adjunct clauses. After pursuing the
sideward movement approach to Pseudogapping (and ultimately Gapping as
well), we outline some important empirical differences between Pseudogapping
and VPE that we think raise substantial problems for any analysis that treats
Pseudogapping and VPE on a par (e.g., Jayaseelan 1990, Lasnik 1995, 1999a,
1999b). We present evidence for a fundamental syntactic difference between
Pseudogapping and VPE, and conclude that the VPE analysis of Pseudogapping
cannot be maintained.},

@article{Tavangar:2006,
	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the ways in which the Persian past
tense form is projected into the future to designate events, states, and processes.
While it must be admitted that the phenomenon under consideration is by no
means confined to Persian, its examination in this language will reveal certain
characteristics which are likely to contribute to a better understanding of how
temporal deixis, together with aspectual and modal meanings, interact with
contextual factors to yield socio-culturally relevant utterances. Of special
theoretical interest in this respect are the semantic-pragmatic constraints levied,
in varying degrees, on the projected tense in terms of negation, pronominal
choice, speech act assignment, aspectual character, modal status, and pitch
contour.
Fundamental to the present study are three assumptions. First, the deictic
projection at issue has pragmatic motivations, and, in addition, stems largely
from the ontological asymmetry between pastness and futurity. Second, it has an
indisputable edge over the other future-indicating devices available to Persian
speakers in that it denotes factivity with respect to the occurrence of a situation.
And third, it is stylistically marked as it digresses from the normal function of the
past tense.},

conjuncts of coordinate structures must be parallel. It states that the conjuncts

appearing in them. The term root is defined in terms of dependency structures.
After the validity of the PR in English and German is established, the discussion
examines the extent to which constituency grammar can explain the parallelism
effect. The argument is made that constituency grammar is indeed in a position to
express the PR, although doing so requires that certain non-standard assumptions
about constituency structures are adopted. Moreover, it is emphasized that the
dependency-based approach is preferable due to its paucity of structure.},

@article{Cohen:2004a,
	Abstract = {While opinions on the semantic analysis of generics vary widely, most scholars agree that generics have a quasi-universal flavor. However, there are cases where generics receive what appears to be an existentialinterpretation. For example, B''s response is true, even though only theplatypus and the echidna lay eggs:
(1) A: Birds lay eggs. B: Mammals lay eggs too.
In this paper I propose a uniform account of the semantics of generics,which accounts for their quasi-existential readings as well as for their more familiar quasi-universal ones. Generics are focus-sensitiveoperators: their domain is restricted by a set of alternatives, which may be provided by focus. I claim that, unlike otherfocus-sensitive operators, generics may, but do not have to, associate with focus. When alternatives are introduced, either by focus or by other means, generics get their usual quasi-universal readings. But when no alternatives are introduced, quasi-existential readings result.I argue that generics, unlike adverbs of quantification, do not introduce tripartite structures directly, but are initially interpreted as cases ofdirect kind predication. Only when this interpretation fails to make sense, the phonologically null generic quantifier is derived, and tripartite structures result. This two-level interpretation has the effect that while adverbs of quantification require focus to determine which elements go to the restrictor and which to the nuclear scope, and hence must associate with focus, generics do not, and hence may fail to associate with focus, resulting in quasi-existential readings.},

We suggest that this provides data that demonstrates that updates resulting from utterances cannot be defined in purely semantic terms, contrary to the prevailing assumptions of existing approaches to dynamic semantics. We offer a computationally oriented analysis of the resolution of ellipsis in certain cases of dialogue clarification. We show that this goes beyond standard techniques used in anaphora and ellipsis resolution and requires operations on highly structured, linguistically heterogeneous representations.

Weargue that in such languages, clauses or verb phrasesnot overtly marked for viewpoint aspect implicateor entail `event realization'', a property akin toParsons''s (1990) `culmination''. The aspectualreference associated with the use of clauses notovertly marked for aspect is computed in accordancewith the dependence of realization conditions ontelicity and in line with principles of Gricean pragmatics.We formalize event realization and capture thetelicity-dependent patterns of aspectual reference onwhich it is based by combining Krifka''s (1989, 1992,1998) event lattices with a model-theoreticinterpretation of Klein''s (1994) theory of tense andaspect. The latter permits us to treat the `topic times''of aspectual operators as temporal constraints on event realization.},

Differencesarise, it is argued, because singular and plural kinds relatedifferently to their instantiations. In languages with determiners,singular kinds typically occur with the definite determiner, butplural/mass kinds can be bare in some languages and definite inothers. An account of singular kinds in terms of taxonomic readingsis proposed, with number marking playing a crucial role inexplaining the obligatory presence of the determiner. The variationbetween languages with respect to plural/mass kinds is explained bypositing a universal scale of definiteness, with individual languageschoosing different cut-off points for lexicalization of the definitedeterminer. The possibility of further cross-linguistic variation isalso considered.},

	Abstract = {This article discusses what may be referred to as ``adjectival relatives''''in Japanese and related constructions in other languages (such asadjectival passives in English). The most intriguing characteristicof this construction is that the verb contained in it occurs in the pasttense form, but its primary role is to describe a state that obtains atthe local evaluation time, rather than the past event that producedthis state. In fact, in some cases, the putative event that presumablyproduced the target state is non-existent, and the entire constructionreceives a purely stative interpretation. In other words, it is possiblefor an adjectival relative to describe a target state without having itstriggering event. The proposal I put forth in the article states that whatI refer to as an adjectival relative does not have a clausal structure.It rather has a verbal projection (technically a Tense Phrase, or TP). Mod(the modifier head) then combined with TP to yield a MP (modifierphrase), which denotes a property of states that appear to have resultedfrom an event the verb describes. In order to reach this conclusion, I adopttwo additional ideas: (i) Kratzer''s (1996) idea that the so-called externalargument of a verb is not really its argument at all; (ii) direct causationdoes not have to be overtly represented in natural language syntax (Bittner1999). Having incorporated these two ideas, the proposal explains therelation between the state that the adjectival relative describes and theputative event as a modal one, thereby accounting for the non-existenceof putative past events in some examples.},

The criterion for salience of a chunk is cognitive: it is dependent onthe way in which the domain is mentally represented. Findings of psychologicalexperiments about the ways in which different domains are represented, and thefactors affecting such representations, account for judgments of generic sentences,facts which cannot be explained by linguistics alone.The reason for the homogeneity requirement itself is, in turn, also dependenton cognitive considerations. Generics express default rules, and psychologicalfindings have shown that, the more homogeneous the domain, the easier it isfor subjects to infer rules about it.

Not only does this allow for a natural and compositional account of how PPs contribute to the aspect of a sentence, but it also guides our understanding of the lexical semantics of prepositions in important ways. Semantically, prepositions turn out to be quite similar to nouns and verbs.

@article{Laserson:2005,
	Abstract = {This paper argues that truth values of sentences containing predicates of ``personal taste'' such as fun or tasty must be relativized to individuals. This relativization is of truth value only, and does not involve a relativization of semantic content: If you say roller coasters are fun, and I say they are not, I am negating the same content which you assert, and directly contradicting you. Nonetheless, both our utterances can be true (relative to their separate contexts). A formal semantic theory is presented which gives this result by introducing an individual index, analogous to the world and time indices commonly used, and by treating the pragmatic context as supplying a particular value for this index. The context supplies this value in the derivation of truth values from content, not in the derivation of content from character. Predicates of personal taste therefore display a kind of contextual variation in interpretation which is unlike the familiar variation exhibited by pronouns and other indexicals.
Most of the work for this paper was completed before I became aware of K{\"o}lbel (2002), which argues for a very similar position (though without the Kaplan-style formalization I develop here). Readers are referred to K{\"o}lbel's book for a fuller philosophical defense of this position, and for programmatic suggestions of a slightly different approach to formal implementation.},

	Abstract = {Abstract  In biscuit conditionals (BCs) such as If you're hungry, there's pizza in the fridge, the if clause appears to apply to the illocutionary act performed in uttering the main clause, rather than to its propositional content. Accordingly, previous analyses of BCs have focused on illocutionary acts, and, this, I argue, leads them to yield incorrect paraphrases. I propose, instead, that BCs involve existential quantification over potential literal acts such as assertions, questions, commands, and exclamations, the semantic objects associated with declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamative sentences, respectively. Such an existential interpretation of BCs requires only that we add potential literal acts to our inventory of individuals, and it produces reasonable paraphrases in which if has its normal meaning: If you're hungry,[there's a (relevant/salient) assertion that] there's pizza in the fridge. These potential literal act variables are introduced into semantic interpretations and then undergo Existential Closure. Hence, we would expect to see similar interpretations in contexts other than BCs, that is, with other if constructions, with connectives other than if, with potential literal acts other than assertion, and in root sentences. This prediction is borne out, along with the parallel prediction that we cannot quantify over purely illocutionary acts like offers, but only over potential literal acts, those conventionally associated with a particular morphosyntactic shape.},

According to Recanati (`Unarticulated Constituents', Linguistics and Philosophy, 25 (2002) 299), extra-linguistic context can have additional truth-conditional effects, in the form of optional pragmatic processes like `free enrichment'. This paper shows that Recanati's position is not warranted, since there is an alternative line of analysis that obviates the need to assume free enrichment. In the alternative analysis, we need Stanley's variables, but we need to give them the freedom to be or not to be generated in the syntax/present at logical form, a kind of optionality that has nothing to do with the pragmatics-related optionality of free enrichment.},

@article{Shan:2006,
	Abstract = { We present a general theory of scope and binding in which both crossover and superiority violations are ruled out by one key assumption: that natural language expressions are normally evaluated (processed) from left to right. Our theory is an extension of Shan's (2002) account of multiple-wh questions, combining continuations (Barker, 2002) and dynamic type-shifting. Like other continuation-based analyses, but unlike most other treatments of crossover or superiority, our analysis is directly compositional (in the sense of, e.g., Jacobson, 1999). In particular, it does not postulate a level of Logical Form or any other representation distinct from surface syntax. One advantage of using continuations is that they are the standard tool for modeling order-of-evaluation in programming languages. This provides us with a natural and independently motivated characterization of what it means to evaluate expressions from left to right. We give a combinatory categorial grammar that models the syntax and the semantics of quantifier scope and wh-question formation. It allows quantificational binding but not crossover, in-situ wh but not superiority violations. In addition, the analysis automatically accounts for a variety of sentence types involving binding in the presence of pied piping, including reconstruction cases such as Whose criticism of hisi mother did each personi resent?},

The approach followed is both successful in providing evidence for the rhythmic
distinction between the two varieties and in relating it to the traditional rhythm
typology. Overall, the results show that EP and BP have clearly distinct mixed
rhythms: stress- and syllable-timing characterise EP, whereas syllable and moratiming
characterise BP. The data further suggest that mixed rhythm is not equivalent
to intermediate rhythm, thus supporting the notion of rhythmic classes against
the scattering of languages along a rhythmic continuum.},

that this is not the only strategy in Spanish for conveying narrow focus through
intonation, as increased F0 peak height may also be used. While either strategy
may be used to convey focus in different positions within an utterance, there is a
difference in frequency which is explained based on the ability to counteract downstep

that quantity is not always stable under prosodic analysis. I document several
cases of mismatches between the structure of a syllable and its weight; these are
similar to the well-known case of Latin shortening, brevis brevians, but they crucially
involve covert lengthening rather than shortening. Such mismatches give
rise to violations of what I call Double Prosody constraints. The proposals in this
paper critically support the covert weight analysis of compensatory lengthening
and the formalization of opacity of Goldrick (2000) and they readdress longstanding
problems in Latin and Romance linguistics. Here, I maintain, contra previous
analyses, that the stress computation for Late Latin is the same as that of Preclassical
Latin but that, by Late Latin, double prosody violations had become frequent
in the stressed penultimate syllable, obscuring a once transparent relationship between
prosody and segmentism.},

@article{Bradley:2006,
	Abstract = {In Dominican Spanish, consonantal reduction in the syllable rhyme is so pervasive
that /s/ is systematically absent from this position. Some speakers attempt
to emulate more conservative styles by reinserting postnuclear /s/, often resulting
in hypercorrection. Epenthesis is unattested before intervocalic taps and
trills, which can be explained in terms of structure preservation if the intervocalic
trill is analyzed as a heterosyllabic geminate tap (Harris 1983, 2001,
2002, N{\'u}{\~n}ez Cede{\~n}o 1988, 1989, 1994). The present study reconsiders the issue
of rhotic representation in light of the Dominican hypercorrection facts. I
show how Padgett's (2003) analysis of Catalan and Spanish, cast within a recent
version of Dispersion Theory (Flemming 1995, 2002), offers a simpler account
of the behavior of syllable-initial rhotics that does not require a geminate
representation. I develop a constraint-based account of epenthesis in which the
appearance of non-underlying [s] is driven by a high-ranking output-output
correspondence constraint. The failure of hypercorrect [s] to appear before
intervocalic rhotics is accounted for by a phonetically-grounded phonotactic constraint against [strident][vibrant] clusters in the output. Since an analysis
in terms of surface phonotactics does not require an underlying geminate
representation of intervocalic trills in Spanish, it is fully compatible with the
Dispersion-theoretic account.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a constraint-based analysis of a process that in Traditional
New Mexico Spanish (TNMS) generates a syllabic consonant from a sonorant
consonant + stressed high vowel combination. It is argued that although vowels
are more suitable than consonants to function as prosodic heads, consonants
may sometimes be favored over vowels in the role of foot and syllable
head. This situation arises when a positional markedness constraint barring
the marked value on the place-of-articulation scale (e.g., Dorsal) from the position
of foot DTE becomes active. Contrary to previous approaches that assume
that vowel deletion is a condition for the syllabization of the consonant,
it is argued that the vowel that disappears in the process of syllabizing a consonant
is not deleted but either absorbed by that consonant or assimilated to
it. It is also demonstrated that syllabic consonants are subject to two universal
alignment constraints that govern their distribution by forcing them to be coarticulated
with another consonant. Although languages may vary as to whether
the syllabic consonant is coarticulated with a preceding or with a following
consonant, there are no languages where syllabic consonants appear between
two vowels or between a vowel and a pause precisely because in such environments
there is not an adjacent consonant available for coarticulation. The
condition that the syllabic consonants of TNMS be coarticulated not with a
preceding, but with a following consonant, is the reason why they do not occur
in prevocalic or prepausal position.},

of positive interaction that may arise between acquisition studies and linguistic
theory. Starting from a full range of comparative studies showing the presence

general constraint on extra-lexical operations of valency-reduction, turning relations
into one-place predicates. This analysis leads to a sort of cross-modular
(re)interpretation of Principle B of Binding Theory and to a radically new analysis
of the relation between (semantic) binding and coreference. Another important
consequence of the proposed analysis is that it supports the view of
Romance clitics as morphosyntactically encoding a lexical operation of reflexivization.

some intriguing and so far poorly understood asymmetries between reflexive

The restrictions in question have been analyzed previously as deriving from
``double anchoring'' of the complement tense, both by the matrix event and by
utterance time. On the basis of evidence from Spanish and Italian, this article
claims that only one of these relations is genuine tense anchoring: anchoring
by utterance time. The other relation, ``event anchoring'' is shown to derive
from the role of complement constituents in ``measuring out'' the aspect of the
matrix predicate. Spanish and Italian provide evidence that the distribution
of the DAR correlates with aspectual properties of the matrix predicate. This
generalization is argued to derive from the capacity of complement clauses
to express a temporal ``Path'' along which a Theme progresses, analogous to
Paths expressed by other constituents such as PPs and DPs. Tense anchoring

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the process of word-final consonant cluster simplification

those that may be reduced in all lexical items (unrestricted simplification), (2)
those that may be reduced in some lexical items but not in others (lexicallydetermined
simplification), (3) those that are always stable. Consonant deletion
is motivated by two distinct factors: the Sonority Sequencing Principle and
a principle requiring that every segment be perceptually salient. The likelihood
that a consonant deletes correlates with the degree to which it violates one of
these principles. Appeal to perceptual factors explains in particular two tendencies.
First, final stops are less susceptible to deletion than other consonants.
Second, cluster simplification correlates with the amount of contrast within the
cluster, in terms of voicing, manner and place of articulation. This analysis of
cluster reduction supports the integration of perception in phonological theory
advocated in a growing body of work. It is formalized within Optimality Theory
and uses in particular perceptually-motivated markedness and faithfulness
constraints militating against perceptually weak segments.},

	Abstract = {Pluractionality (PLR) is the morphological category that generally signifies multiple actions. This paper, based on original fieldwork, provides the first investigation of PLR in Chechen, a Nakh language spoken in the eastern central part of the North Caucasus. The data reflects the standard dialect of Chechen spoken in and near the cities of Murus-Martan and Grozny. Chechen PLR, which is marked by stem vowel alternations, prototypically signifies the repetition of an event (e.g., saca/sieca `to stop once/many times'; laaca/liica `to catch once/many times'). The plurality of the nominative argument can affect the interpretation of some verbs (e.g., ghitta `to wake up'; hitta `to assume a standing position'), rendering the reading distributive. More interestingly, a durative reading, signaling the prolongation of an event, is available for some verbs (e.g., xouzha/xiizha `to ache momentarily/for a while', zouza/ziiza `to itch momentarily/for a while') but not others. Following Ojeda (1998) and Lasersohn (1995), PLR is accounted for in terms of the pluralization of the event argument of a predicate. The various semantic effects are the results of interactions between the aspectual properties of individual verbs and event pluralization.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of (surface) DP-internal quantifying expressions on semantic interpretation. In particular, I investigate two syntactic constructions in which an adjective takes scope out of its embedding DP, thus raising an interesting question for strict compositionality. Regarding the first construction, I follow Larson (1999) and assume that the adjective incorporates into the determiner of its DP, forming a complex quantifier [D+A]. I present new evidence in favor of this analysis. Since Larson's semantic analysis of complex quantifiers [D+A] makes a wrong prediction, I propose an alternative, empirically more adequate analysis that treats D+A compounds as pluractional quantifiers in the sense of Lasersohn (1995). Finally, I turn to the second construction, arguing that -- despite superficial similarities to the first construction - it should not be analyzed in terms of complex quantifier formation, but in terms of LF-movement of the adjective to Spec,DP. The discussion suggests that there is more than one way for DP-internal modifiers to take DP-external scope in natural language.},

On one reading, the temporal adjective modifies the common noun (N-modifying reading). On the other, it modifies the possession relation (POSS-modifying reading). An explanation for this behavior is offered that appeals to what occurs in possessive sentences like John has a former car (N-modifying reading) and John formerly had a car (POSS-modifying reading). In the sentential cases, the source of two readings is two distinct, modifiable phrases. Given the parallels, we propose a structure for possessive nominals analogous to that of possessive clauses. Specifically, we argue that such nominals include a locative small-clause structure, following Freeze (1992), and we explain the ambiguity structurally, as a simple matter of where temporal adjectives attach (NP vs. PP). We show that this analysis provides a straightforward basis for the semantic composition of possessive nominals.},

Sandstr{\"o} m proposes that for events described in the simple past, the temporal interpretation of such sequences varies according to whether A describes a culminated process (CP)(accomplishment) or a culmination (CULM)(roughly, an achievement). She offers an account of this behaviour based on the claim that culminations denote changes of state while culminated processes do not. I argue that this claim is unmotivated, and in addition, draw attention to a range of counterexamples to her generalisation. I present an analysis which is not based on the CP/CULM distinction but relies instead on the distinction originally proposed by Dowty (1979) between the event structures CAUSE-BECOME and BECOME. I show that this distinction is closely related to whether the event has a prototypical agent. It is therefore thematic structure rather than temporal structure that determines the behaviour of when in these cases.},

My approach is based on the insight that implicit frequentative aspect plays a central role in this interaction, a fact that was largely ignored in previous analyses. Specifically, I interpret frequentative aspect as an abstract verb-level pluractional operator that brings about aspect shift and that is responsible for the distribution of subevent times and subevent participants over the event time of an atelic sentence. What Zucchi and White (2001) call "the aspectual effect of frequency adverbs" thus becomes the general rule for all frequentatively understood for-adverbial sentences. Linguistic support for silent verb-level frequentativity in English is drawn from overt frequentative aspect marking in West Greenlandic verbs.},

This allows focus theories to generalize below the word level; any differences with focus above the word level are located in the semantics of word parts.

Support for this view of specificity comes from the behavior of indefinite this in spoken English, as well as from specificity markers in Samoan, Hebrew, and Sissala. It is shown that the conditions on the use of this-indefinites cannot be accounted for by previous analyses of specificity. The relationship between definiteness and specificity in article systems crosslinguistically is examined, and a distinction between presuppositions and felicity conditions is argued for. Additional evidence for the reality of specificity comes from a study of article choice in the English of adult second language learners (whose L1s, Russian and Korean, lack articles). It is shown that the learners' errors are tied to specificity: they consist largely of overuse of the in specific indefinite contexts, and overuse of a in non-specific definite contexts. It is concluded that specificity is a universal semantic distinction, which receives morphological expression crosslinguistically and is available to second language learners.},

In the universal construction in Japanese, the restrictor (provided by an indeterminate phrase) sometimes appears to be separate from the universal particle mo. It is proposed that quantification at a distance is only apparent, and that the restriction is in fact provided locally by the sister constituent of mo as a whole. The proposal leads us to a straightforward uniform picture of the syntax-semantics mapping of the universal construction and wh-questions, building upon Hamblin's (1973) semantics for wh-phrases as sets of alternatives. It allows for a switch of perspective on a long-standing puzzle regarding locality effects in the indeterminate--particle association by deriving the locality pattern from the way indeterminate phrases are interpreted and associated with particles, without any stipulations.},

Unlike focus, wh-phrases make no ordinary semantic contribution. An intervention effect occurs whenever a focus-sensitive operator other than the question operator tries to evaluate a constituent containing a wh-phrase. It is argued that this approach can capture the universal as well as the crosslinguistically variable aspects of intervention effects, in a way that is superior to previous approaches.

@article{Kim:2004,
	Abstract = {Korean is thought to be unique in having three kinds of voiceless stops: aspirated /ph th kh/, tense /p* t* k*/, and lax /p t k/. The contrast between tense and lax stops raises two theoretical problems. First, to distinguish them either a new feature [tense] is needed, or the contrast in voicing (or aspiration) must be increased from two to three. Either way there is a large increase in the number of possible stops in the world's languages, but the expansion lacks support beyond Korean. Second, initial aspirated and tense consonants correlate with a high tone, and lax and voiced consonants correlate with a low tone. The correlation cannot be explained in the standard tonogenesis model (voiceless-high and voiced-low). We argue instead that (a) underlyingly "tense" stops are regular voiceless unaspirated stops, and "lax" stops are regular voiced stops, (b) there is no compelling evidence for a new distinctive feature, and (c) the consonant-tone correlation is another case of voiceless-high and voiced-low. We conclude that Korean does not have an unusual phonology, and there is no need to complicate feature theory.},

@article{Miyagawa:2004,
	Abstract = {Ditransitive verbs such as send and give appear in two distinct structures in English, the double object and the to-dative constructions. It is well known that the two differ semantically and syntactically. In some recent works, it is suggested that the semantic differences observed by Bresnan (1978), Oehrle (1976) and others, and the structural properties noted by Barss and Lasnik (1986), Larson (1988), and others, can both be captured by postulating an extra head for the Double Object Construction (DOC, e.g., Marantz (1993), Harley (1995), Pylkk{\"a}nen (2002)). This head, which corresponds to the applicative head in Bantu languages, takes the goal as its specifier and relates it either to the VP that contains the verb and the theme (Marantz (1993)), or directly to the theme (Pylkk{\"a}nen (2002)). The applicative head contributes the meaning distinct to the DOC, and it gives rise to the hierarchical structure noted by Barss and Lasnik. This applicative head is missing in the to-dative so that this construction has an argument structure distinct from the DOC. In this paper, we will look at the corresponding construction(s) in Japanese. Unlike English, Japanese appears to have only one structure, in which the goal is marked with the dative and the theme with the accusative case marking. The goal-theme order is assumed to be the basic order (Hoji (1985), Takano (1998), Yatsushiro (1998, 2003)). The only variation is that the theme can occur before the goal, but this is viewed simply as an instance of optional scrambling. We will give arguments that the difference between English and Japanese is only apparent. With close scrutiny, we find that the two argument structures corresponding to the DOC and the to-dative in English exist in Japanese.},

While this fact accounts for many similarities between English and Korean counterfactuals, some differences between the two languages are also attested. The variation in form-meaning mapping between English and Korean counterfactuals is accounted for with the proposal that once the past tense is mapped onto the meaning component that conveys counterfactuality, the range of possible temporal interpretations for a counterfactual is literally determined by the LF of the relevant clause minus the past tense morpheme. If this LF has a present (or past) interpretation, the counterfactual will have a present (or past) interpretation. But if this LF is not interpretable, the counterfactual will not be interpretable either, resulting in ungrammaticality.},

	Abstract = {In past studies of the Korean and Japanese morphological passives (KMP and JMP, respectively), emphasis has been put on their similarities. To explain their differences (e.g., only the JMP has a subvariety called indirect passive), several authors have attempted to capture the relation between the KMP and JMP on a continuous scale, where the KMP is more ``restricted'' than the JMP. The ``continuity'' approach to the KMP/JMP is, however, hard to maintain for two reasons. First, under the continuity hypothesis it is hard to explain the link between the KMP/JMP and their related constructions, i.e., the causative for the former and the spontaneous, potential, and honorific for the latter. Second, the continuity hypothesis cannot explain why the two constructions invoke an adversity implicature under different conditions. I argue that the KMP and JMP have substantially different core syntax/semantics and examine the sources of adversity implicatures associated with them. The KMP is semantically monostratal and is associated with a construction-specific adversative meaning (conventional implicature). By contrast, the JMP encodes the triadic relation of ``lack of control'' among an agent, an undergoer, and an event; the adversative meaning of the indirect passive is derived as a conversational implicature.},

First of all, the significance of variable case ellipsis patterns of Korean, as found in the CallFriend Korean corpus (LDC (1996)), will be demonstrated when looked at from a functional-typological perspective: variation in case marking between style levels within a single language reflects variation across languages. In a second step, the findings from a comparative study of Korean and other languages are integrated into a coherent theoretical framework -- stochastic Optimality Theory (OT) (Boersma (1998), Boersma and Hayes (2001)). It is shown that quantitative patterning found in Korean case ellipsis can be analyzed within the stochastic OT framework in a way analogous to an account of categorical differential case marking effects proposed by Aissen (2003). In this analysis, categorical differential case marking found in various languages is viewed as conventionalization of the same universal pragmatic tendency to mark disharmonic elements, which is also present in the variable case-marking systems of languages like Japanese and Korean.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to show that there is a striking difference in word order between Modern Japanese and Early Old Japanese. Early Old Japanese lacks the canonical transitive pattern [Subject-ga Object-o V]. The basic word order in Early Old Japanese is [Subject-ga/no Object-{\O} V], in which the subject is marked by the genitive ga or no and a morphologically unmarked object must appear immediately adjacent to the verb. When the object is marked by wo, it is obligatorily moved over a subject, resulting in [Object-wo Subject-ga/no V]. Following Miyagawa (1989) and Miyagawa and Ekida (2003), I argue that a bare object is assigned abstract case under the strict adjacency requirement, but that wo in Early Old Japanese does not function as an accusative case. The particle wo differs crucially from the case particle o in Modern Japanese in that it marks not only the direct object of a transitive verb, but all kinds of internal arguments of both transitive and intransitive verbs. Furthermore, wo conveys a definite interpretation. An element marked by wo moves to a particular structural position, namely Spec(vP) or Spec(CP), where it is assigned definite/topic interpretations.},

The argument crucially relies on the proposal, independently made in the literature, that certain cases of null arguments involve ellipsis rather than empty pronouns.},

@article{Wu:2005,
	Abstract = {This paper provides a new semantics for the perfective le. The perfective le can denote
completion, termination and inception. It has context-dependent semantic behaviors: it
denotes termination only when completion is canceled, and it cannot go with an activity
without an appropriate linguistic context. The Significant Point (SigP) analysis is proposed
to account for the different semantics of the perfective le. The SigP of an
achievement is its natural final endpoint. The SigP of an accomplishment is, by default,
its natural final endpoint. The SigP of an activity is underspecified and an appropriate
linguistic context can impose a SigP on an activity. The SigP of a stage-level state is its
starting point and the SigP of an individual-level state is undefined. The perfective le is
argued to identify the SigP of the predicate it goes with, and to locate the interval from
the starting point to the SigP before a reference time. Different SigPs of different situation
types result in different readings when predicates of different situation types go
with the perfective le. In order to capture the context-dependent semantics of le, this
paper argues that, in addition to a compositional semantics, the perfective le is also
associated with a set of meaning postulates which specify contextual affects on the
semantics of le.},

@article{Matthews:2005,
	Abstract = {A distinctive syntactic feature of the Chaozhou dialect group is the use of the same
morpheme in the passive and in certain intransitive constructions. In the Jieyang variety,
the passive marker k'eG derived from the verb `give' requires an agent, a requirement
which we relate to the subcategorization of the lexical verb `give'. We show that the same
morpheme is used with unaccusative verbs in the form [k'eG i V], where i is an expletive
pronominal: it cannot encode an agent because the unaccusative predicates concerned
lack an agent argument. Therefore what appears to be a passive marker with agent in
fact constitutes overt coding of unaccusativity, of a kind unusual in Chinese dialects but
paralleled in several Indo-European languages. The passive and unaccusative constructions
are shown to share thematic and aspectual properties: the surface subject
carries the role of theme or patient, and the predicate denotes a change of state, hence
the requirement for a resultative verbal complement (RVC). The [k'eG i V-RVC] construction
is shown to involve formation of an unaccusative complex predicate, with the
RVC contributing a change of state component to the aspectuality of the predicate.},

@article{Kong:2005,
	Abstract = {This study looks at the acquisition of obligatory overt arguments in L2 English by adult L1 Chinese speakers and sets out to explain the divergence between non-native speakers and native speakers in relation parameter-resetting in SLA within the framework of Principles and Parameters. In particular, we test a proposal made by Yuan [1997, Studies in Second Language Acquisition 2, 16--32] which argues for initial full transfer of the Chinese functional category features into L2 English. Chinese speakers then readjust the features of Infl as a result of contact with English, and this requires their grammars to have obligatory subjects. However, they continue to allow null objects in their English simply because positive evidence is not available to eliminate them. The implication of Yuan's proposal is that features of functional categories in the L2 which differ from those in the L1 are in principle resettable, which argues against the claim made by Tsimpli and Roussou [1991, UCL Workings Papers in Linquistics 3, 149--170], and Smith and Tsimpli [1995, The Mind of Savant: Language Learning and Modulority, Blackwell, Oxford.] that parameter values associated with functional categories are inaccessible to L2 learners after the critical period.
The results do not lend support to Yuan's claim that the recognition of the features of Infl in English causes Chinese speakers to unlearn null subjects while lack of positive evidence in relation to functional category features allows them to continue accepting null objects. Rather, they support the view of Tsimpli and Roussou and Smith and Tsimpli that older learners do not reset their parameters. It could be argued that learners are more successful in disallowing null matrix subjects than null arguments in other positions because they make a small adjustment to the use of topic chains while the parameter settings of Chinese are maintained. This adjustment is that one topic at the head of every sentence must be overt.},

@article{Kurisu:2005,
	Abstract = {This paper examines five independent morphological processes in contemporary Japanese: renyookei reduplication, dvandva compounds, plural reduplication, mimetic reduplication, and zuuzya-go. Common to them is that the resulting form can be divided into two portions (e.g., base and reduplicant, or two members of a compound). Some of the morphological processes exhibit prosodic augmentation through vowel lengthening or segmental epenthesis, but others do not. Among the group of those phenomena with prosodic augmentation, the augmentation is shared by the two halves of a produced word in one case but not in others. Given these two parameters, the five morphological operations display a three-way gradient pattern: (i) both prosodic augmentation and prosodic sharing occur (renyookei reduplication), (ii) neither occurs (dvandva compounds and plural reduplication), and finally, (iii) prosodic augmentation occurs, but it is not shared by the two halves of a word (mimetic reduplication and zuuzya-go). This paper has both descriptive and theoretical goals. First, I demonstrate that prosody of the five morphological constructions exhibits such a gradient pattern through a careful description. Second, on the theoretical side, I offer a detailed comprehensive analysis of the prosodic gradation within the framework of Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky (1993)). I argue that the notion of relativized faithfulness is essential, relativization referring to morphemes. This intra-linguistic comparative study thus lends support to Kurisu (2001b; 2005) who argues for the necessity of morpheme-specific faithfulness constraints.},

	Abstract = {Takayama (1999) recently proposed a new rendaku-based vocabulary stratum hierarchy for Japanese, in which what he terms a vulgarized Sino-Japanese stratum is treated separately from, and occupies a more core position than, the traditional Sino-Japanese (SJ) stratum. However, Takayama deliberately excludes from his analysis one particular subset of the SJ vocabulary layer, monomorphemic SJ lexemes (SJ mononoms), and focuses exclusively on bimorphemic SJ lexemes (SJ binoms), claiming that analytical difficulties caused by another voicing phenomenon known as shindaku(Okumura (1952)), which occurs only in the SJ stratum, hampers any attempt to ascertain the frequency of rendaku amongst SJ mononoms. As it has been established that the stratum to which the initial element in a dual element noun compound belongs is not a factor conditioning rendaku in the second element (Ohno (2000)), examining comparatively under-researched hybrid noun compounds whose second element is a SJ mononom allows us to bypass any interference caused by shindakuand establish the frequency of rendaku occurrence amongst SJ mononoms. Such a corpus of hybrid noun compounds whose second element is a SJ mononom is presented here, to the authors knowledge the first time any such corpus has appeared in print, an analysis of which shows that rendaku is in fact more than twice as likely to occur amongst SJ mononoms as amongst SJ binoms. When a further dynamic, the faithfulness of SJ mononoms to a prosodic size factor proposed by Rosen (2001) for native Japanese lexemes, is taken into consideration, it is clear that not only, at the very least, must Takayamas vulgarized SJ stratum be amended to incorporate SJ mononoms, but that there is also a strong case for proposing an independent vulgarized SJ mononom stratum occupying an even more central position than the vulgarized SJ binom stratum.},

The starting point is the two adverbial expressions, dou and quan, both of which are often translated as all.

While we concur with the view that dou can function as a distributive operator, we argue that quan itself is neither distributive nor quantificational. Its sole semantic function is to restrict the domain of distributive quantification. The incompatibility of quan in various environments is attributed to this single reason: quan is merely a domain regulator for distributivity.},

The problems this phenomenon poses for phonology still need to be treated, however, and the extent to which function word contractions set the stage for the evolution of inflected function words from simple cliticization remains to be explored. This paper first addresses issues with regard to the prosodic representation of function word sequences preceding lexical words (i.e., [Fnc Fnc Lex]). Investigating such contractions in a number of German dialects, it will be shown that a sequence of Fnc Fnc constitutes a special phonological unit of its own, which is arguably a trochaic foot that adjoins to the neighboring prosodic word. It will be argued that this analysis accounts for several phonological processes that are peculiar to function word contractions, and also predicts phonological fusion in which the second function word is reduced. Second, the paper suggests that the phonological fusion of function words sets the stage for a number of diachronic processes such as reanalysis and analogical extension, which arguably lead to the evolution of paradigms of inflected function words.},

Since it concerns possessive relatives primarily, an integrated approach to the syntax of relativization and attributive possession is sought for. Possessive relatives directly reflect the three basic types of attributive possession, namely, the prepositional, the genitive, and the possessive pronoun construction. It is claimed that the promotion theory of relative clauses can be successfully combined with an analysis of possession in which the prepositional construction is taken to be the basis for the other types. Furthermore, it is shown that heavy pied-piping is normally dependent on the presence of a prepositional phrase. In general, pied-piping is claimed to be a possible consequence of overt or covert head movement. Finally, the effect of the so-called R-transformation on pied-piping and preposition stranding in relative clauses is discussed. The different possibilities shown by English, Dutch, and German are argued to be consequences of the theoretical possibilities of creating a syntactic relation, namely, by XP movement, overt head movement, or covert movement.},

terms,is to reiterate the fundamental importance of semantics in the control problem, and to
articulate some of the semantic factors more precisely than has heretofore been possible. After
presenting familiar obstacles to a theory of control based on syntactic binding,we make a threeway
distinction between `unique control' (usually called OBLIGATORY CONTROL),`free control',
and `nearly free control' (the last two falling under traditional NONOBLIGATORY CONTROL). We
show that in a very large class of cases of unique control,the controlled VP denotes an action
and the controller is the character who has the onus for that action. This analysis is applied to
four major classes of control verbs and their nominals,as well as a class of adjectives,showing
that semantic role reliably identifies the controller,and syntactic position does not. Through a
formalization in terms of CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE,we begin to be able to explain much of control
directly from the lexical decomposition of the matrix verb. Several classes of exceptions to the
conditions on unique control are treated as cases of coercion,in which extra conventionalized
semantic material is added that is not present in syntax.},

@article{Levinson:2003,
	Abstract = {Most approaches to spatial language have assumed that the simplest spatial notions are (after
Piaget) topological and universal (containment, contiguity, proximity, support, represented as
semantic primitives such as IN, ON, UNDER, etc.). These concepts would be coded directly in
language, above all in small closed classes such as adpositions---thus providing a striking example
of semantic categories as language-specific projections of universal conceptual notions. This
idea, if correct, should have as a consequence that the semantic categories instantiated in spatial
adpositions should be essentially uniform crosslinguistically. This article attempts to verify this
possibility by comparing the semantics of spatial adpositions in nine unrelated languages, with
the help of a standard elicitation procedure, thus producing a preliminary semantic typology of
spatial adpositional systems. The differences between the languages turn out to be so significant
as to be incompatible with stronger versions of the UNIVERSAL CONCEPTUAL CATEGORIES hypothesis.
Rather, the language-specific spatial adposition meanings seem to emerge as compact subsets of
an underlying semantic space, with certain areas being statistical ATTRACTORS or FOCI. Moreover,
a comparison of systems with different degrees of complexity suggests the possibility of positing
implicational hierarchies for spatial adpositions. But such hierarchies need to be treated as successive
divisions of semantic space, as in recent treatments of basic color terms. This type of analysis
appears to be a promising approach for future work in semantic typology.},

of the Latin gender system in its transition to Old French. The network reanalysis was based
solely on formal cues (word endings and analogy with other words) and on frequency. The results
are in accordance with the historical data, and certain errors in simulations are also amenable to
principled explanations. Simulations improve dramatically when the networks incorporate information
about the Celtic substrate which presumably interfered with gender assignment in Gallo-
Romance. This finding has a bearing on issues of gender assignment and processing in bilinguals.
Simulations also improve with the introduction of more elaborate recurrent networks, which
suggests implications for future connectionist modeling. In particular, the results could be applied
to the modeling of gender change in other Romance languages and to the modeling of comparative
Romance gender systems. The method proposed here would be advantageous for such simulations
since it allows the modeler to take into account a rich variety of facts reflecting actual linguistic
history.},

development of AFRICAN AMERICAN VERNACULAR ENGLISH (AAVE) remain unresolved. These
include the regional accommodation of earlier African American speech; the sources of its current,
distinctive structural features; and the past and present trajectory of change. To address these
questions, this study examines several longstanding, isolated biracial sociolinguistic situations in
the coastal and the Appalachian regions of North Carolina. One of these situations involves a
core community of African Americans, whereas two of the situations involve case studies of
isolated speakers. A comparison of diagnostic phonological and morphosyntactic variables for
speakers representing different generations of African Americans and baseline European American
speakers suggests that extensive accommodation to localized dialects characterized earlier African
American speech. At the same time, the maintenance of an exclusive subset of dialect features
suggests persistent substrate influence and long-term ethnolinguistic distinctiveness along with
local dialect accommodation. Younger African Americans in some historically isolated rural
regions appear to be moving away from the localized dialects toward a more generalized AAVE
norm.},

	Abstract = {So-called NEW ENGLISHES, distinct forms of English which have emerged in postcolonial settings
and countries around the globe, have typically been regarded individually, as unique varieties
shaped by idiosyncratic historical conditions and contact settings, and no coherent theory to
account for these processes has been developed so far. This article argues that despite all obvious
dissimilarities, a fundamentally uniform developmental process, shaped by consistent sociolinguistic
and language-contact conditions, has operated in the individual instances of rerooting the
English language in another territory. At the heart of this process there are characteristic stages
of identity construction by the groups involved, with similar relationships between the parties in
migration contact settings (i.e. the indigenous population and immigrant groups, respectively)
having resulted in analogous processes of mutual accommodation and, consequently, similar
sociolinguistic and structural outcomes. Outlining a basic developmental scenario, I suggest that
speech communities typically undergo five consecutive phases in this process---FOUNDATION,
EXONORMATIVE STABILIZATION, NATIVIZATION, ENDONORMATIVE STABILIZATION, and DIFFERENTIATION---
and I describe the sociolinguistic characteristics of each one. This framework is then
applied to case studies of seven different countries (Fiji, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand) which, I argue, are currently positioned at different points
along the developmental cycle.},

FOR DEPENDENT RELATIONS (RDDR) account, van der Lely 1998) by investigating WH-movement
in fifteen G-SLI subjects and twenty-four younger children matched on language abilities (LA
controls). The RDDR/optional movement account predicts that G-SLI subjects would have deficits
with both WH-operator and Q-feature movement and therefore would have particular problems
producing object questions. We elicited 36 questions balanced for subject and object questions
and WH-words (who, which, what). The G-SLI subjects were significantly impaired in producing
WH-questions, showing particular difficulties with object questions in relation to the control children.
The majority of G-SLI subjects (80%) evinced both WH-operator and T/Q-feature movement
errors whereas only one control child (4%) did so, yet on occasion all the G-SLI subjects used
appropriate movement operations to satisfy the WH-criterion. We conclude that the RDDR account
whereby movement is optional is consistent with the findings of correct and incorrect WH-question
formation. Thus, this first test of the RDDR account of G-SLI is supported by the findings.
We discuss the possible underlying nature of a grammar that could cause such optionality, the
implications for normal and impaired language acquisition, and the generalizability of the findings
to other groups of children with SLI. We propose that in the face of no movement, the WH-word
and, on occasion, do are merged in situ in the CP, and function as an interrogative adjunct.},

	Abstract = {The semantics of simple (i.e. two-term) systems of demonstratives have in general hitherto
been treated as inherently spatial and as marking a symmetrical opposition of distance (`proximal'
versus `distal'), assuming the speaker as a point of origin. More complex systems are known to add
further distinctions, such as visibility or elevation, but are assumed to build on basic distinctions of
distance. Despite their inherently context-dependent nature, little previous work has based the
analysis of demonstratives on evidence of their use in real interactional situations. In this article,
video recordings of spontaneous interaction among speakers of Lao (Southwestern Tai, Laos) are
examined in an analysis of the two Lao demonstrative determiners nii4 and nan4. A hypothesis
of minimal encoded semantics is tested against rich contextual information, and the hypothesis
is shown to be consistent with the data. Encoded conventional meanings must be kept distinct
from contingent contextual information and context-dependent pragmatic implicatures. Based on
examples of the two Lao demonstrative determiners in exophoric uses, the following claims are
made. The term nii4 is a semantically general demonstrative, lacking specification of ANY spatial
property (such as location or distance). The term nan4 specifies that the referent is `not here'
(encoding `location' but NOT `distance'). Anchoring the semantic specification in a deictic primitive
`here' allows a strictly discrete intensional distinction to be mapped onto an extensional range
of endless elasticity. A common `proximal' spatial interpretation for the semantically more general
term nii4 arises from the paradigmatic opposition of the two demonstrative determiners. This kind
of analysis suggests a reappraisal of our general understanding of the semantics of demonstrative
systems universally. To investigate the question in sufficient detail, however, rich contextual data
(preferably collected on video) is necessary.},

forced-choice elicited production tasks showed that four-year-olds have early knowledge of the
animacy hierarchy restrictions, providing evidence of syntactic generalization even on low-frequency
constructions. Although there were no verb frequency effects, performance was also better
on the highest-frequency animacy constructions. The results suggest that learning restrictions on
verb-argument structure is facilitated when verb semantics is not a confound, but that construction
frequency also plays a role in mastering the argument structure of verbs.},

distinct lineages. Furthermore, the candidate histories we obtain appear to be consistent with

that the distribution and interpretation of degree modifiers is sensitive to its twomajor classificatory
parameters: (1) whether a gradable predicate is associated with what we call an open or closed
scale, and (2) whether the standard of comparison for the applicability of the predicate is absolute
or relative to a context. We further showthat the classification of an important subclass of
adjectives within the typology is largely predictable. Specifically, the scale structure of a deverbal
gradable adjective correlates either with the algebraic part structure of the event denoted by its
source verb or with the part structure of the entities to which the adjective applies. These correlations
underscore the fact that gradability is characteristic not only of adjectives but also of verbs
and nouns, and that scalar properties are shared by categorially distinct but derivationally related
expressions.},

sociolinguistic patterning in the adult community. Variant usage in CDS was found to differ
markedly from that in interadult speech. Effects were also found with respect to the age and

than speech to boys, which, by contrast, contained higher rates of vernacular variants. The differentiation

of English transitive and intransitive V-P constructions involving so-called `particles' (turn
on the lights/the lights on, mess up the song/the song up, shut up, sit down, etc.). Drawing on
both standard and certain new evidence and arguments, it is proposed that V-P constructions
generally come in one or both of two varieties: lexical compounds (mess up in mess up the song)
and/or discontinuous verbs, that is, lexemes with more than one piece projected as a word or
phrase (mess . . . up in mess the song up), and that the alternation, for those that have both
manifestations, reflects different argument structure possibilities for a lexemewith the same overall
conceptual semantics. The internal structure of VPs built on V-P lexemes is examined in some
detail. The popular `small-clause' approach, according to which the DP of transitive V-P structures
is the subject of a phrase that has the P as its predicate, is shown to be problematic, primarily
because there in fact exists a true small-clause construction that can have a P as its predicate and
the putative small clause of cases like mess the song up systematically lacks the defining properties
of this construction. The word-order restrictions that the small-clause approach is designed, in
part, to account for are shown to follow from a set of independently needed linearization constraints,
which are motivated by functional principles.},

lexical items are arrayed, accompanied by the full panoply of phonological representations from

tract is calculated leading to a sound output. Two parallel processes are involved in the calculation
of these instructions, both of which replace the planning-stage representation by the appropriate
motoric instructions. One of these processes is universal and involves replacing each distinctive
feature with an appropriate set of motoric instructions, either unmodified or modified by the
process of overlap. We postulate a parallel language-specific process that is sensitive to those
features in danger of losing their perceptual saliency as a consequence of the environment in
which they appear. This process, referred to as ENHANCEMENT, adds additional motoric instructions
to enhance the saliency of the jeopardized features. We provide a number of examples to illustrate
how enhancement works. We conclude from these examples that whereas defining gestures related
to distinctive features are, in many instances, weakened or even absented from the speech stream,
enhancement gestures, once added to the set of motoric instructions, appear never to be subject

A- to A0-positions as well as movement across clause boundaries, thereby unifying the
derivational steps involved in unrelated constructions. I argue that, within a clause, an
element can only ever move to the next higher Prolific Domain (Intraclausal
Movement Generalization), whereas movement across clauses targets a position
within the next higher Prolific Domain of the same type (Interclausal Movement
Generalization). These two generalizations are claimed to boil down to an interaction
between standard locality and anti-locality considerations. Consequently, we can
observe a transparent symmetry in locality issues, which I take to be a desirable result.},

anaphors that is common to virtually all other cases of variable binding, viz. c-
command. To achieve this, I am led to refine the notion of ``adjunct''; in particular, the
status of the if-clause in conditionals. I argue for the well-foundedness of such an
attempt by establishing a detailed parallelism between donkey anaphors and parasitic
gaps. It is shown that recent accounts of parasitic gaps in terms of sideward movement
(Nunes 1995, 2001) can also capture the core properties of donkey anaphora. If
correct, the arguments presented here strengthen the derivational approach to syntactic
relations pursued in much recent work, and the recent attempts to capture rules of
construal via movement operations (Hornstein 2000, Kayne 2002, Boeckx 2001},

head-final in the Nupe language whereas others seem to be head-initial. Several
converging arguments are given that verbs come before their complements in the
underlying structure. Apparent counterexamples come from the presence of
identifiable functional heads within the verb phrase structure that attract NPs to their
specifier position. Two such heads are distinguished: AgrO
0, which attracts an NP
nonlocally for purposes of licensing accusative Case, and Infin0, which attracts the
closest NP to check an EPP feature regardless of whether it is Case marked. We
briefly compare our analysis to remnant movement analyses to sharpen the typology
of leftward movement in natural language. We conclude that the success of Kayne's
(1994) approach to word order depends on uncovering and cataloging the triggers of
these movements.},

economy condition, the Earliness Principle (EP), which requires a feature to be
eliminated as early as possible. EP predicts that the search space for feature checking
should increase throughout the derivation with the growth of the phrase marker. This
prediction is shown to be manifested in ``agreement displacement,'' where agreement
morphology under certain conditions cross-references a noncanonical argument.
Agreement displacement shows that u-features of a head may seek a DP outside the
complement of that head, after the cycle on which search exhausts the complement, as
predicted by EP. A detailed look at Basque ergative displacement, which differentially
affects person and number, leads to the conclusion that agreement may happen only
once per interpretable feature. The blocking of multiple Agree relationships is
implemented as a locality effect, based on the construal of Case as a functional
category introduced by Agree.},

The central claim of this paper is that the position of these types of expressions within the noun phrase limits the kinds of dimensions they may describe. The limitations have to do with whether or not the dimension tracks relevant part-whole relations. An analogy is made between these constraints and the well-known constraints on thematic relations that are incurred by the position of a noun phrase in a clause. A proposal is made about the meanings of expressions like too much and 2 pounds which explains their common cross-categorial distribution and this informs the analysis of their use in noun phrases. A position is taken on the meaning of the count mass distinction which, in conjunction with the hypothesis about dimensions, explains asymmetries in the distribution of prenominal adjectives with count and mass nouns.},

of the inflectional (Infl) particles, which interact in crucial ways with finite V(erb)
movement to M(ood). We claim that children perceive Infl particles as phrasal specifiers

even in their presence, and clitics emerge in (nonadult) postverbal position,
giving the impression that they have been misplaced. We point out that functional
heads seem to be perceived as phrasal in other early languages and possibly also in domains
other than Infl, and we explain why clitics are not found misplaced in standard
Greek and standard Romance, with the exception of Portuguese. Finally, the absence
of qualitative differences between the early populations and populations with SLI we
studied corroborates with views that consider SLI a language delay, but the degree to
which quantitative differences were attested raises questions.},

absence of such structure what is expected is not a systematic omission of functional
material but rather its random (over)use. Random use of functional material is attested
in agrammatic speech in which we suggest it may indeed stem from absent or
deficient functional structure. On the other hand, the early grammar is characterized
by full, albeit phonologically unrealized, functional structures. Such phonologically
unrealized functional structures, we suggest, are interpreted in the early grammar

analysis, the standard analysis of child English no for more than 30 years, is
untenable as a general analysis of child English no. The results also suggest that although
children make many mistakes using no, they represent no as a determiner in
abstract syntax and control the Phonetic Form principles that regulate the use of discourse
ellipsis with no DPs at a very early age.},

	Abstract = {Universal Grammar (UG) allows a multitude of devices that can be drawn on to express
focus. The child's task is to reconcile the possible UG options with the positive
data provided by the target language. In English, except for the cleft structure, focus
is indicated by word stress. I argue that some children initially hypothesize that focus
is signaled by syntactic movement. The empirical evidence in favor of this argument
comes from a longitudinal diary data from one child, A.L., from age 1;9 to 2;4.
In contexts in which the subject of the sentence receives either contrastive or emphatic
focus, A.L. produces utterances like ``You're do it,'' or ``I'm do it.'' The nominative
pronoun and an agreeing form of be are claimed to be moved to a position of
focus in the phrase structure. Further, the first-person utterances like ``I'm do it'' are
preceded by utterances with the form ``My do it'' in the same contexts. This leads to
the proposal that my is a metathesized form of I'm, not a genitive pronoun as
claimed in previous literature. As a consequence, subjects bearing genitive case are
claimed not to exist in child English.},

	Abstract = {Number acquisition is a field of research with a wealth of studies mainly by psychologists.
In this article, I try to add some linguistic insights. To acquire all number words
with their meanings as a basis for further mathematical thinking---at least other numerals
than those for small numerosities like [two] or [three] (and maybe [ four])---a
child has to learn a number sequence as a list of speech forms meaningless at first. It is
claimed that general principles of rhythm and coordination explain the child's ability to
learn by rote a sequence of such speech forms and their word class. I show that these
principles also apply in the acquisition of sequences of the names of the days of the week
and the names of the months. As far as the development of the counting abilities for numbers
up to [a hundred] is concerned, I argue that the particular rhythmical structure of
the sequence provides the child with the raw material to develop a concept ``decade
word.'' The child will have to learn by rote a second sequence, that is, the sequence of the
decade numbers [10, 20, 30, etc.]. This is an important step in the detection of the algorithm
that ultimately makes the generation of all natural numbers possible. I argue that
the theory of reduction from Lerdahl and Jackendoff's (1996) generative theory of music
may explain this step.},

@article{Thompson:2006a,
	Abstract = {The representation of agreement is a crucial aspect of current syntactic
theory, and therefore should apply in both signed and spoken languages.
Neidle et al. (2000) claim that all verb types in American Sign Language (agreeing,
spatial, and plain) can occur with abstract syntactic agreement for subject and object.
On this view, abstract agreement can be marked with either manual agreement
morphology (verb directed toward locations associated with the subject/object) or
non-manual agreement (eye gaze toward the object/head tilt toward the subject).
Non-manual agreement is claimed to function independently as a feature-checking
mechanism since it can occur with plain verbs not marked with overt morphological
agreement. We conducted a language production experiment using head-mounted
eye-tracking to directly measure signers' eye gaze. The results were inconsistent with
Neidle et al.'s claims. While eye gaze accompanying (manually/morphologically)
agreeing verbs was most frequently directed toward the location of the syntactic
object, eye gaze accompanying plain verbs was rarely directed toward the object.
Further, eye gaze accompanying spatial verbs was toward the locative argument,
rather than toward the object of transitive verbs or the subject of intransitive verbs as
predicted by Neidle et al. Additionally, we found a consistent difference in the height
of directed eye gaze between spatial and agreeing verbs. Gaze was directed lower in
signing space for locative marking than for object marking, thus clearly distinguishing
these two argument types. Plain verbs occurring with null object pronouns
were not marked by gaze toward the location of the object and always occurred with
an overt object topic. Thus, Neidle et al.'s analysis of null objects as licensed
by agreement (manual or non-manual) was not supported. Rather, the data substantiated Lillo-Martin's (1986) claim that null arguments for plain verbs are
licensed by topics. To account for the observed patterns of eye gaze, we propose an
analysis of eye gaze agreement for agreeing and spatial verbs as marking the `lowest'
available argument on a noun phrase accessibility hierarchy.},

if the subject of a transitive verb is to be focused, questioned or relativized; this
form, which renders the verb morphologically intransitive, though semantically
transitive, is called `agent focus' among Mayanists. The respective Mayan languages
differ in the morphosyntactic implementation of agent focus, i.e. the
agreement patterns, the marking of the internal argument and the contexts in
which agent focus occurs. The goal of this paper is to provide a lexical approach
that accounts for the cross-Mayan variation by means of a small set of faithfulness
and markedness constraints. It is proposed that the agent focus marker
emerged as a means of disambiguation (by Bidirectional Optimization) and was
grammaticalized, thus extending it to contexts where it is not needed and is even
counterproductive in terms of the visibility of the arguments' /-features (person

movement out of a phonologically and. semantically interpreted domain. Support for
this conclusion comes from a phenomenon of question truncation that I call auxdrop.
I show that aux-drop questions differ minimally from full questions in that
their auxiliary, though present early in the derivation, moves to a position in which it
is interpreted neither phonologically nor semantically. I also argue that this deletion
through movement is not subject to a recoverability condition. The analysis finds a
natural place in a theory where head movement is syntactic (not purely phonological)
and spell-out is cyclic. This approach explains the emergence of the factative effect --
a type of tense interpretation pattern found in ``bare sentences'' in, e.g., Haitian
Creole and F cngbe` -- in an obscure corner of certain languages that normally require
full tense specification in finite clauses. My approach finds further support in the
patterning of aux-drop questions with VP topicalization and pseudoclefts with

greater degree of similarity than the data actually show, and we conclude that an

@article{Sigurdhsson:2006,
	Abstract = {Under the view of nominative Case taken by Chomsky (2000, 2001),
one would expect nominative to be the marked or complex Case, being
merged after accusative. In fact, however, it is the other way around,
nominative preconditioning accusative and also being the Case of simple
structures (unaccusative, etc.). The article argues that this Nominative
Puzzle is not real, the nominative argument in fact being the first
argument merged, raised across the accusative later in the derivation
for independent reasons. This approach not only accounts for the dependency
correlation between accusative and nominative (Burzio's
Generalization), but also offers a derivational account of Condition A
correlations (anaphors being merged higher than their ``antecedents'').
Importantly, it also makes it possible to explain Icelandic quirky constructions
in terms of a general matching theory. In addition, the article
develops a novel approach to Move as applying for the purpose of
successful feature matching.},

	Abstract = {Appositive relative clauses differ in some essential respects from restrictive
relative clauses. I argue that appositive relatives and appositions
can be put together as a third class of coordination denoting
specification. Thus, an appositive relative is a specifying conjunct to
the visible antecedent. It is a semifree relative with a pronominal head
that is normally empty. Therefore, its internal syntax is equivalent to
that of restrictive relatives; hence, there is one syntax for both types
of relative clauses. In essence, it is the context of specifying coordination
that accounts for the different behavior of appositive relatives. In
the light of this analysis, the properties of appositive relatives (as
opposed to restrictive relatives) are systematically reviewed.},

interpretations, I propose here that events with a definite end point
involve interpretation of the verb and either a bounded direct object
or a bounded PP in the checking domain of Asp(ect)P, whereas unbounded
events involve interpretation in a projection lower in the
clause. This analysis explains the syntactic behavior of the ambiguous
adverb quickly. In addition, it follows from the analysis that durative
adjuncts are adjoined to VP, while time frame adjuncts are adjoined
to AspP. Constructions involving preposition stranding, scope of only,
parasitic gaps, and semantic restrictions on adjunct PP objects support
this approach.},

the distinction between reduplicated and nonreduplicated stems with

and (b) the patterns of reduplication (C1VC2VC2C,
C1VC2C3VC3C, C1VC2C1CVC2C,and C1C2VC3C2CVC3C). These issues
are studied from a surface point of view,accounting for speakers'
capacity to parse forms with identical consonants regardless of their
base. It is argued that the grammar constructed by the learner on the
basis of structural relations (base -- output) can also serve for parsing
surface forms without reference to a base.},

Its set of kinship terms presents an opportunity to investigate the categories constituting their underlying semantic nature, which in turn can be described formally in terms of the interrelated processes of base generation of underlying forms and lexical attachment of the kinship terms to yield the surface forms.  The principle of disjunctive lexical sttachment of the terms with respect to their underlying categorial specifications affords an elegant characterization of meaning whereby each term has one such specification for all its apparently varied surface meanings.  The universal validity of this and other principles is suggested.},

Thsi paper argues that it is necessary to posit at least four functional projections above NP (\#P, CaseP, QP, and DP) and massive phrasla movement of such functional projections in order to provide a principled account for the structural diversity of the numeral + classifier combination in Japanese. New evidence from minimizer expressions and pseudo-partitives, which have not been systematically investigated before, is brought to bear on details of the analysis. Japanese is an excellent testing ground for exploring the nature of the noun-related functional projections, becuase some of them, such as \# and Case, are argued to be overtly realized (as a classifier and Case particle, respectively).},

A straightforward analysis of this system can be provided in McCarthy and Prince's (1994a, 1999) Generalized Template Theory (GTT), in which the shape of reduplicative morphemes is derived by general constraints on the phonological properties of morphological categories. In Lushootseed, roots tend to permit codas and stressed schwa, while affixes avoid both. The differences between the three Lushootseed reduplicants follow from the assumptions that the CVC-reduplicative morpheme is a root, while CV- and -VC are affixes. In addition to confirming the central tenets of GTT, this study uncovers a markedness implication for reduplication: if a langauge has unmarked root reduplicants it will aslo have unmarked affix reduplicants.},

However, a detailed examination of the phonological distributions of segments and tones, combined with a careful analysis of the phonetic realizations of duration and pitch in both citation forms and connected speech, lead to the conclusion that the system is in fact complex and interesting. Based on data from an acoustic experiment, we claim that the tone bearing unit in Thai is the mora, and that previously unexplained restrictions on the distributions of tones in syllables closed by obstruents are the result of a relationship between the glottal feature and low tones. We describe and explain unespected differences int he realization of tones in different phrasal positions in connected speech, and show that there are non-neutralizing contour tone simplifications that take place non-finally at the post-lexical level. Our analysis combines decriptive phonetics and phonology with both representational and constraint-based explanations (incorporating positional faithfulness and stratal OT) to provide a unified account of hte Thai tonal system. Our study supports a view of the grammar in which phonetics and phonology are separate, yet intricately related.},

	Abstract = {The paper focuses on resumption in Greek relative clauses. It is argued that resumption arises on two occasions: (i) as a last resort strategy when identification of phe-features of non-arguments fails; (ii) in the absence of a syntactic feature on C trigerring Agree/Move. In the first case obligatory resumption is restricted to non-argument positions and is sensitive to islands. This is the case of Greek null operator restrictive relatives. In particular, it is argued that identification requirements are grammaticised on Greek C (pu), which is endowed with phi-features. Failure of Agree of the phi-features of pu leads to resumption in non-argument positions. In quiestions and operator restrictive relatives identification reqruirements are straightforwardly satisfied by the presence of an overt operator; resumption therefore is never obligatory in these structures. In the secon case, where resumption is the consequence of absence of a sytactic relation (agree/move) between C and the relativeised site, resumption is obligatory in argument and non-argument positions (modulo the highest subject restriction) and insensitive to islands. Greek non-restrictive relatives and Semit restrictive relatives exemplfy this case.},

These projections occur between Force and Finiteness, which delimit the complementizer system, and may be realized by various modal particles in Saramaccan and Gungbe. It is argued that the Saramaccan form `fu' represents two complementizers typels `fu1', which encodes irrealis mood under Force, and fu2, which realized deontic modality under Finiteness. The same holds for the Gungbe conditional complementizer ni1, which merges under Force, and ni2, which expresses deontic modality under Fin. This would mean that both Force and Fin express mood specifications, contrary to what is commonly assumed in the literature.},

	Abstract = {We report a cross-linguistic investigation of English and Swedish speaking children with specific language impairment in an attempt to determine whether Exler's (1998; 2003) (Extended) Unique Checking Constraint can account for the gramamtical profiles of these groups of children. In study 1, a group of Swedish-speaking preschoolers with SLI showed greater use of finite verb inflections and copula forms than a groups of English-speaking preschoolers with SLI, even though the two grups were carefully matched according to both age and severity of language impairment. In study 2, the same Swedish-speaking children with SLI showed high levels of appropriate verb-second use with finite verbs. However, they were less proficient in this regard than a group of younger typically developing Swedish children with similar mean lengths of utterance. The findings from both studies are generally compatible with predictions based on the EUCC. Issues in need of future investigation are discussed.},

	Abstract = {This article is concerned with the correspondence conditions that hold between certain semantic relations --- including part-whole relations, possession, location, and the semantic features [animate] or [count] --- and certain syntactic structures including genitives and relative clauses. The objective is to determine the extent to which these correspondence conditions derive from UG or are "learned" by children in response to input from caretakers and others. Interface conditions imposed by UG are expected to appear early in the course of language development despite the vagaries of the primary linguistic data. In this article, we show that children as young as 3 years old adhere to specific semantic distinctions and to specific constraints ont he mapping of these distinctions onto syntacic structures. Moreover, the children show more stingent adherence to interface conditions than adult speakers of the same languages do, indicating that children's mapping relations between syntax and semantics are not based on their experience but rather projected from UG. },

@article{Takahashi:2006a,
	Abstract = {Comparative quantifiers, such as more than three books, cannot take 
scope over any quantifier in subject position if they occupy object position. This is clearly 
different from the behavior of other quantifiers (e.g., universal quantifiers). This paper 
argues that this scope puzzle is due to a more complex internal structure of comparative 
quantifiers than other quantifiers. In the decompositional approach that I pursue, 
comparative quantifiers are decomposed into two generalized quantifiers (i.e., in the case 
above, the comparative operator er than three and the DP many books). In this approach, 
obligatory narrow scope of comparative quantifiers in object position is a consequence 
of the interplay of the independently motivated principles of grammar that also con- 
strain other quantifiers. On the basis of the scope puzzle, I specifically argue for two 
constraints on Scope Shifting Operations (SSOs): a locality condition on SSOs and 
Scope Economy, proposed by Fox (2000), which prohibits SSOs that have no effect on 
semantic interpretation. Thus, I argue that the apparently peculiar facts of comparative 
quantifiers are, in fact, additional evidence for the core properties of SSOs.},

@article{Woolford:2006,
	Abstract = {In addition to the division in Case theory between structural and non-structural Case, the theory must distinguish two kinds of nonstructural 
Case: lexical Case and inherent Case. Lexical Case is idiosyncratic 
Case, lexically selected and licensed by certain lexical heads (certain 
verbs and prepositions). Inherent Case is more regular, associated with 
particular  -positions: inherent dative Case with DP goals, and ergative 
Case with external arguments. Lexical and inherent Case turn out to 
be in complementary distribution with respect to  -positions: only 
themes/internal arguments may have lexical Case, and only external 
arguments and DP goals may have inherent Case. This complementary 
distribution can be accounted for under recent views of vP structure 
that place both external arguments and (shifted) DP goals outside the 
VP proper at the point at which nonstructural Case is licensed. Claims 
in the literature that the more regular datives and ergatives are actually 
structural Cases are based on faulty or misleading diagnostic tests.

@article{Clifton:2006,
	Abstract = {Two experiments investigated the acceptability of multiple questions. 
As expected, sentences violating the Superiority Condition were ac- 
cepted less often than sentences obeying it. The status of the Superior- 
ity violations was not improved by the addition of a third wh, regardless 
of whether the third wh was an adjunct or an argument, though it was 
improved by the addition of a second question (e.g., and when ). Fur- 
ther, in a small pilot study directly comparing a sentence with adjacent 
final wh-phrases that may induce a stress clash ( I'd like to know who 
hid it where when ) with a sentence violating Superiority but avoiding 
the final adjacent wh-phrases ( I'd like to know where who hid it when ), 
half the participants indicated that the Superiority violation sentence 
sounded better. This suggests that the status of some additional-wh 
sentences may appear to improve simply because the comparison sen- 
tence with adjacent final wh-phrases is degraded. Overall, the results 
of the studies suggest that there is no need to complicate syntactic 
theory to account for the additional-wh effect, because there is no 
general additional-wh effect. },

ena, we will argue against their weakening analysis. We provide argu-

	Abstract = {This paper argues against the view that Hindi has a single strategy of relativization, traditionally referred to as the correlative construction, which is typologically distinct from relativization in languages like English.  It is shown that Hindi, in fact, has two types of relative clauses which are syntactically and semantically distinct.  Hindi embedded and right-adjoined relative clauses are generaqted inside NP and function like noun modifiers.  They are similar in essential respects to restrictive relative clauses in English.  Hindi left-adjoined relative clauses, on the other hand, are adjoined to IP at D-structure.  They do not function like noun modifiers but are quantificational expressions binding variables inside their scope domain.  It is suggested that left-adjoined relatives belong typologically with free relatives in English and internally-headed relatives in Quechua, since they have certain significant properties in common with these constructions.},

In particular, disjoint reference effects, island conditions, and weak crossover phenomena are investigated in some detail.  Facts from these domains mtivate a theory of Mohawk clause structure in which most NPs are generated in adjunct positions, alon the lines proposed by Jelinek (1984) and others.  Clausal arguments, however, do not show standard subject-object asymmetries, unlike NPs.

	Abstract = {Experimental findings from the neuropsychological study of language are used to evaluate grammatical theories.  Data from test sentence comprehension by agrammatic aphasic patients reveal a pattern of selectivity that is used as a means for assessing competing syntacitic hypothesis.  In particular, it is argued that agrammatic linguistic behavior provides evidence for a transformational analysis of verbal passive.  This is so because the patients failed to comprehend properly verbal passives and structures involving Wh-movement, but succeeded in tasks that required the proper comprehension of lexical passive.  Grammatical theories in which such a performance pattern can be readily described-- namely, theories that allow for generalizations such as Move-alpha-- pass a test of psychological reality in that they are compatible with patterns of language breakdown observed following brain damage.  By contrast, syntactic frameworks in which all passives are derived by lexical rules cannot account for this performance pattern without the introduction of ad hoc devices.  Neurolinguistic findings are thereby shown to restrict the class of biologically feasible grammars.},

@article{Emonds:1991,
	Abstract = {Classic problems of  how to generalize over predicate-argumetn realtions (e.g., 'buy' vs. 'sell'; 'spray paint' vs. 'spray a wall') have led to postulating semantic representations which are structured differently than deep syntax, such as (linked) theta grids and (lexical) conceptual structures.  I argue that such autonomous semantics massively violates parsimony, and that theta-roles are better predicted by using onlyl modestly enhanced, independently justified deep structures.  In addition, I claim that several recent generalizations (of Rizzi, Levin and Rappaport, and Randall) are better formulated as deep syntactic properties than in terms of theta-roles.
	The syntactic approach to predicate-argument relations thus reinitiates a line of research implicit in Chomsky's 'Aspects' but never developed.  The first section argues that only this approach faithfully applies to the syntactic revolution to lexical (head-complement) semantics.
	Principles invoked include Chomsky's Full Interpretation and Rule for Agents and Talmy's Figure/Ground separation, along with a new Ground Specification and syntactic counterparts to two formal devices from Jackendoff's Conceptual Structures.  The thematic role constellations for many verb classes (mostly but not all from English) are shown to follow from these principles.  The conclusion speculates that the theta-roles assigned to a sentence are not its properties at a linguistic level, but rather indicate how that sentence is to modify cogniitive representations.},

	Abstract = {This article addresses the interaction of syllabification adn templatic morphology in Yawelmani.  The morphological templates (in CV terms, CVCC, CVVCC, and CVCVVC) do not parse directly into well-formed Yawelmani surface syllables (CV, CVV, CVC).  Nonetheless, as argued here, these templates can be expressed in terms of legitimate prosodic units, thereby supporting the prosodic morphology hypothesis (McCarthy and Prince 1986, 1987, 1990).  The basic idea is that segments map from left to right to the template, but if the template is too small, any leftover stem consonants simply undergo left to right syllabification.  This analysis accounts for the general templatic mapping of verbs and nouns as well as the different kinds of reduplication in Yawelmani.  It also provides a more explanatory account of the 'ghost' consonants-- initial consonants in some of the suffixes which surface only when the stem is biconsonantal, but not if the stem is larger.  The analysis not only provides support for the prosodic morphology hypothesis, it also argues in favor of a templatic view of syllabification (Ito 1986, 1989) and a rule of Weight-by-Position (Hayes 1989) operating independently of the general syllabification process.},

This paper argues that such structural solutions do not work, since the same scope problems are reflected in phrases based on underived words with no morphological bracketing at all.  In their place, a solution based on Decompostitional or Featural Composition is proposed, in which attributes compose semantically not with the full set of features of their head, but rather with only one particular feature.  This solution reduces the wide and narrow scope readings of attribute phrases to a question of which feature is selelcted, in effect making all attribute composition the same and obviating the distinction between wide and narrow scope readings of attribute phrases.},

We argue that these divergences reflect a real dichotomy between unbounded dependencies with fillers in A(rgument) positions, e.g. 'tough' constructions, and those whose fillers occupy non-argument (A-bar) positions, e.g. topicalization.  We first show that strong external evidence exists supporting the GPSG-internal prediction of full syntactic connectivity between A-position fillers and their gap sites, but that this result seems contradicted by the existence of case conflict between the filler and gap.  To overcome this contradiction, we introduce a new gap-licensing feature GAP, and show how a number of other divergences between A- and A-bar filler/gap constructions follow as a consequence.},

All of these theories fail in a significant case, that in which both bound positions are canonically governed.  Here, there is frequently no WCO effect.  This paper pursues a government-theoretic account, analyzing the presence or absence of the WCO effect in terms of an ECP which incorporates canonical government.  The grammar in focus is that of Palauan, whose basic order is VOS.  A principled distinction among SVO, VOS, and other grammars is provided by a specifier parameter, which sets the specifier position in realtion to that of other constituents of the phrase and determines how specifiers are governed.  The distribution of WCO effects follows from the interaction of the specifier parameter and canonical government.},

We argue that the Bengali facts support a typology of intonational tones that includes only pitcha ccents and boundary tones, and that the docking sites for boundary tones are the phrase edges provided under the theory of the Prosodic Hierarchy (Selkirk 1980).  We show that Bengali intonational contours are governed by the {O}bligatory {C}ontour {P}rinciple ({OCP}), which forbids adjacent identical tones.  Underlying contours that violate the {OCP} are converted to permissible surface forms by a phonological rule.  We also bring Bengali data to bear on a long-standing controversy concerning phrasal stress:  Bengali can be shown to have a default, phonologically assigned phrasal stress pattern; thus phrasal stress assignment cannot be reduced exclusively to focus and other semantic factors.},

At Level 1, the principle of {\sc structure preservation} (Kiparsky 1985) enforces conformity with the Coda Condition, thus explaining the distribution of complex codas as well as the application of vowel shortening.  Apparent exceptions to the Coda Condition result from an independent principle which licenses an additional rime position if the position is half of a partial geminate (Ito 1986).

Stump suggests that this lack of agreement is an instance of a Complementary Principle, a generalization which states that overt argument NPs do not cooccur with agreement in Breton.  In this paper, we show that the empirical generalization underlying Stump's analysis is quite dubious.  Moreover, it is impossible to prevent a topicalization analysis for affirmative subject-initial sentences; indeed, evidence from coordination shows that the topicalization analysis must be available.  We suggest that the absence of agreement is due to a different generalization:  there is no agreement with wh-trace subjects in affirmative clauses.

McCloskey (1984) argues that the Irish raising construction involves NP-movement to a VP-internal position, contrary to the Projection Principle.  The new analysis proposed here claims that it really involves movement (of an inherently Case-marked NP) to subject position, and thus poses no problem for the Projection Principle.  However, this analysis does pose a direct challenge to the Uniformity Condition, since it involves a verb assigning inherent Case to an NP that it does not theta-mark.  The paper proposes a new theory of inherent Case assignment that allows for the possibility of the Irish construction, but is sufficiently restrictive so as to account for the rarity of nonthematic inherent Case assignment.},

This leads to a digression concerning the similar enclitic stress in the Austronesian language Manam.  Attention is then focussed on the fact that in some languages-- e.g., in Winnebago-- foot boundaries may occur inside sylklables that have more than one stress-bearing element, whereas in other languages-- e.g., in Cairene Arabic and Yupik Eskimo-- syllable-internal foot boundaries are not allowed.  To deal with this type of variablility it is proposed that in addition to idiosyncratic stresses the theoretical framework must admit also idiosyncratic constituent boundaries.  The effects of these theoretical innovations are illustrated by an examination of stress assignment in different Yupik dialects.},

We argue that word-initial and non-word-initial extrasyllabic consonants play distinct roles in th eoperation of phonological rules.  We further claim that they are integrated prosodically by linking to the phonological word node and that this is done at different stages of derivation.  Transparency of extrasyllabic consonantns is also investigated.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes that affricates are composed of [-cont] and [+cont] specifications which are unordered at underlying representation and throughout the phonological derivation, although they are ordered phonetically.  Previous autosegmental treatments of the affricate, which include this ordering as part of the underlying representation, can handle edge effects, which are cases where rules refer to only the adjacent value of [cont].  But the ordered representation cannot account for anti-edge effects:  those rules which involve the nonadjacent value of [cont].  Moreover, it predicts that ordering of the gestures is a possible phonological contrast, but this is incorrect, as no language has [+cont][-cont] single segments.  As predicted by the unordered representation, all apparent cases of phonological edge effects can simply be stated as rules referring to a value of [cont]; all rules which show true edge effects occur after the values are phonetically ordered.},

A single-headed GPSG analysis of the construction is proposed and argued for, and the implications of the analysis for number agreement are discussed. The semantic properties of the construction (and its counterpart in Polish) are subsequently detailed and are compared with those of `ordinary' NP coordination: the preliminary conclusion is that the construction differs both in denotation adn in conventional meaning from NP coordination.},

discusses whether or not natural language employs a temporal system that explicitly 
quantifies over times at the level where semantic interpretation takes place. I first argue 
that a single-index theory is not empirically adequate for natural language. I then pro- 
pose a system in which times are syntactically represented. The system works in such a 
way that tense morphemes saturate the time argument slots of the predicates they attach 
to. Consequently it predicts that only the times of the main tensed predicates of clauses 
are accessible. Empirical evidence is presented showing such a distinction between 
tenseless and tensed predicates in terms of the accessibility to the times introduced by 
them.},

	Abstract = {The meaning of `we' is usually seen as `I 
+ others'. Russian, along with many other 
languages, has a construction that allows an overt specification of `others', the so-called 
Plural Pronoun Construction (PPC), which involves a plural pronoun and a comitative 
phrase. The syntactic behavior of this comitative phrase differs from that of other with- 
phrases such as VP-adjuncts, NP-adjuncts, and comitative conjuncts. We will argue that 
the syntactic behavior of the PPC-comitative follows from its syntactic status as a 
complement of the plural pronoun D . We will also suggest a formal semantic analysis of 
PPC, where the comitative phrase is argued to supply the unsaturated element in the 
interpretation of the plural pronoun.},

even, featuring the negative polarity items einmal and auch nur in addition to affirmative 
sogar. This study reports novel findings on the meanings of einmal and auch nur which 
are unexpected under existing analyses of English even. First, the particles einmal and 
auch nur are shown to differ from sogar in that they consistently contribute information 
about the truth values of alternative propositions, as opposed to their mere likelihood. 
Second, it is shown that the implications in question do not have the compositional 
behavior of presuppositions and instead call for the assumption that einmal and auch nur 
quantify existentially over alternative propositions at the level of truth conditions. },

regarding CP structure (e.g., Grohmann's [2003] division of clause structure into three 
domains) and extends them to account for the properties of Spanish DPs (following 
Grohmann & Haegeman 2002). The resulting analysis enables us to explain the full 
paradigm regarding the different possibilities of extraction observed in Spanish DPs 
from the locality (Manzini 1994, Fox & Lasnik 2003) and anti-locality (Bos? kovic ? 1994, 
1997; Grohmann 2003, among others) conditions on movement that elements within 
DPs must satisfy. The differences among nonspecific DPs, specific DPs, and some 
definite DPs with respect to extraction are the result of the presence or absence of the 
DP projection in the structure.},

@article{Carlson:2005,
	Abstract = {The processing of ellipsis sentences can provide clues to their structure, as 
their structure can influence their processing. We present two studies examining the 
processing of a previously unexplored subclass of ellipsis sentence, gapping sentences 
in which one of the remnants is a preposed PP (PPGs). Like some other gapping 
structures, PPGs are ambiguous between readings in which a DP remnant is interpreted 
as a subject or as an object. However, we find that PPGs exhibit a weaker and more 
flexible object bias than other ambiguous gapping sentences (Carlson 2001a, 2002), 
one comparable to clausal ellipsis constructions like comparatives and replacives. We 
argue that this result supports the syntactic assumption that gapping is a nonuniform 
phenomenon: PPGs involve clausal conjunction on either reading, much like 
comparative ellipsis, while regular gapping has a nonellipsis alternative (Johnson 
1996), which underlies the strong preference for an object reading.},

@article{Alrenga:2005,
	Abstract = {In this article, I defend a particular solution to a long-standing problem 
concerning the syntactic behavior of the verb seem---namely, its failure to take a 
sentential subject (*That the Giants lost the World Series seems). I show that this 
restriction follows straightforwardly if, following Koster (1978), sentential subjects are 
analyzed as topic phrases linked to a phonetically null DP in Spec,IP. I further suggest 
that this DP is an argument (not an expletive) and that it eventually undergoes 
A'-movement, making sentential subject constructions a species of the null operator 
constructions discussed in Chomsky 1977. The analysis is supported by (i) active/ 
passive asymmetries involving sentential subjects, (ii) agreement phenomena, (iii) 
restrictions on A'-movement across sentential subjects, (iv) parallels between sentential 
subject and CP-topicalization constructions, and (v) the distribution of embedded 
sentential subjects. The analysis also correctly predicts certain facts concerning the 
co-occurrence of seem and sentential subjects in raising constructions. An interesting 
consequence of the analysis is that some form of idiosyncratic selection for DP 
complementation must be available within the lexicon, contrary to what has been 
suggested elsewhere.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines vowel harmony initiated by a weak trigger. 
Height harmony in Veneto Italian dialects, wherein a post-tonic high vowel triggers 
raising of preceding mid vowels, forms a case study. Veneto presents two variable 
patterns: stress-targeted harmony, in which harmony propagates to the stressed 
syllable, and maximal extension harmony, in which raising persists to pretonic 
vowels. The conditions under which weak vowels trigger and control harmony are 
examined. It is argued that weak trigger harmony is motivated by perceptual dis- 
advantage: harmony improves exposure of the spreading feature, accomplished 
either by extending to a stressed position or maximizing duration in the word. The 
apparent primacy of the vowel quality in weak position in Veneto is accounted for by 
markedness factors that independently prevent the stressed vowel from overriding it. 
In regard to positional privilege, it is argued that positional licensing (markedness) 
drives stress-targeted spreading -- positional faithfulness cannot be responsible for 
strong targets. A weak trigger pattern emerges when licensing constraints operating 
over perceptually marked structure dominate positional faithfulness. Crosslinguistic 
applications are also explored.},

In particular, I argue that due to its initial  merge position, `why' in an interrogative clause is licensed with external merge while 
`why' in a declarative clause must undergo LF-movement. This argument is supported by the non-uniform behavior of `why' with respect to the Intervention Effect in  Korean and Japanese (cf. Beck and Kim 1997) and is further confirmed by the 
question-marker drop phenomenon in Japanese. Under this proposal, a puzzling divergence between Chinese and Korean/Japanese in why-constructions is reduced to the fact that Chinese disallows Abar-scrambling. The proposal also captures a syntactic parallelism between `why' in wh-in-situ languages and `why' in wh-fronting languages, like Italian and Irish. Among the theoretical consequences of this paper is a demonstration that a subject may scramble (cf. Saito 1985) and that string-vacuous scrambling is responsible for judgment variations concerning the Intervention Effect.},

quite dissimilar languages (German, Japanese, and Itelmen) expected interpretations 
curiously, but systematically, fail to arise. The missing interpretations are precisely 
those that would be expected if Agree -- the establishment of licensing relations 
without movement -- were possible; this is shown by comparison to minimally dif- 
ferent constructions that establish both the existence of the Agree operation and the 
independent possibility of the interpretations in question. The account we are led to 
suggests that locality domains are not absolute but are relativized in two ways: firstly, 
Agree and A-movement respect different (if overlapping) locality conditions, and 
secondly, whether or not a given projection constitutes a domain boundary depends 
partly on its syntactic context. At the core of the paper is the proposed generalization 
that A-movement is forced, and cannot reconstruct, exactly when a DP originates in 
a lower agreement domain than its licensor.},

light on the properties of sense and their relation to computation, but also shows
circular behaviour if some ingredients of the Liar Paradox are added. The connection
is natural, as algorithms can be inherently circular and the Liar is

	Abstract = {This paper presents a variable-free analysis of relational nouns in
Glue Semantics, within a Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) architecture. Relational
nouns and resumptive pronouns are bound using the usual binding mechanisms
of LFG. Special attention is paid to the bound readings of relational nouns,
how these interact with genitives and obliques, and their behaviour with respect to
scope, crossover and reconstruction. I consider a puzzle that arises regarding relational
nouns and resumptive pronouns, given that relational nouns can have bound
readings and resumptive pronouns are just a specific instance of bound pronouns.
The puzzle is: why is it impossible for bound implicit arguments of relational nouns
to be resumptive? The puzzle is highlighted by a well-known variety of variable-free
semantics, where pronouns and relational noun phrases are identical both in category
and (base) type. I show that the puzzle also arises for an established variable-based
theory. I present an analysis of resumptive pronouns that crucially treats resumptives
in terms of the resource logic linear logic that underlies Glue Semantics: a resumptive
pronoun is a perfectly ordinary pronoun that constitutes a surplus resource; this
surplus resource requires the presence of a resumptive-licensing resource consumer, a
manager resource. Manager resources properly distinguish between resumptive
pronouns and bound relational nouns based on differences between them at the level
of semantic structure. The resumptive puzzle is thus solved. The paper closes by
considering the solution in light of the hypothesis of direct compositionality. It is
argued that a directly compositional version of the theory is possible, although
perhaps not desirable. The implications for direct compositionality are considered.},

I then focus on Richard Jeffrey's `random-variable' approach, which circumvents these
problems by giving up the notion that conditionals denote propositions in the usual sense.
Even so, however, the random-variable approach makes counterintuitive predictions in
simple cases of embedded conditionals. I propose to address this problem by enriching
the model with an explicit representation of causal dependencies. The addition of such
causal information not only remedies the shortcomings of Jeffrey's conditional, but also
opens up the possibility of a unified probabilistic account of indicative and counterfactual
conditionals.},

	Abstract = {Bertrand Russell introduced several novel ideas in his 1903 Principles of Mathematics that he later gave up and never went back to in his subsequent work. Two of these are the related notions of denoting concepts and classes as many. In this paper we reconstruct each of these notions in the framework of conceptual realism and connect them through a logic of names that encompasses both proper and common names, and among the latter, complex as well as simple common names. Names, proper or common, and simple or complex, occur as parts of quantifier phrases, which in conceptual realism stand for referential concepts, i.e., cognitive capacities that inform our speech and mental acts with a referential nature and account for the intentionality, or directedness, of those acts. In Russell's theory, quantifier phrases express denoting concepts (which do not include proper names). In conceptual realism, names, as well as predicates, can be nominalized and allowed to occur as ``singular terms'', i.e., as arguments of predicates. Occurring as a singular term, a name denotes, if it denotes at all, a class as many, where, as in Russell's theory, a class as many of one object is identical with that one object, and a class as many of more than one object is a plurality, i.e., a plural object that we call a group. Also, as in Russell's theory, there is no empty class as many. When nominalized, proper names function as ``singular terms'' just the way they do in so-called free logic. Lesniewski's ontology, which is also called a logic of names can be completely interpreted within this conceptualist framework, and the well-known oddities of Lesniewski's system are shown not to be odd at all when his system is so interpreted. Finally, we show how the pluralities, or groups, of the logic of classes as many can be used as the semantic basis of plural reference and predication. We explain in this way Russell's ``fundamental doctrine upon which all rests'', i.e., ``the doctrine that the subject of a proposition may be plural, and that such plural subjects are what is meant by classes [as many] which have more than one term'' (Russell 1938, p. 517).},

We define a truth functions which determines the truth values p:t iff of an L-proposition p with respect to a theory T. Theories are sets of L-propositions with associated truth values, and can be viewed as a (much more well-defined) replacement for possible worlds. We develop a mechanism for defining belief worlds as theories. We simultaneously develop two different versions of our system -- a Boolean version where the set X of truth values is f0-1g, and a degree-truth version where X is the interval [0,1] of real numbers. We use degrees of truth in handling a broad class of semantic predicates that we call base--focus predicates, which include generalized quantifiers as well as many adverb and adjective senses and certain discourse-level predicates.},

The role of some standard distinctions found in the literature is weakened or put in a new perspective. The distinction between universal and existential is no longer an intrinsic property of FCIs. Similarly, the opposition between variation-based
vs intension-based analyses is relativized. We show that the regime of free choiceness can be characterized by an abstract constraint, that we call Non-Individuation (NI), and which can be satisfied in different ways that match current distinctions. NI says that the information conveyed by a sentence containing a FCI should not be reducible to a referential
situation, that is a situation in which particular individuals satisfy the sentence in the current world. The widely used resource of modal variation becomes a particular scenario of free-choiceness, not its `essence'. In fact, we show that under certain conditions, FCIs can occur in episodic, non-modal sentences, a fact that NI can accommodate. We also discuss more fine-grained aspects of the semantics of FCIs, such as their emotional colour.},

My analysis differs from Zimmermann's in that it is more general and renders the logical form of disjunctive sentences less complex, but the main innovation is that the context dependence of modality is called upon to play a leading role. The theory
applies not only to disjunctions of `may'-sentences but also covers universal modalities and conditional disjuncts. The paper concludes with a discussion of narrow-scope `or'.},

	Abstract = {This article describes a variety of intonation patterns in Central Catalan and examines the process of tonal realization of these tunes over short sequences, namely, monosyllabic phrases and utterances containing just one stressed syl-
lable. When faced with multiple association, Catalan displays at least three different procedures to adapt intonational contours: when the tune is composed of one pitch accent plus a boundary tone sequence, the general strategy used by this language is compression; by contrast, when the tune is made out of two pitch accents plus an edge tone sequence the solution is either to delete (or fail to associate) the first pitch accent (a process which could be understood as tune truncation) or the second one. The contrast between compression and deletion strategies falls out directly from an autosegmental view of intonational contours: since a given metrically strong position cannot bear more than one pitch accent, compression is thus ruled out when melodic tunes contain a minimum of two pitch accents. The contrast between the failure to link the first or the second pitch accent, though, cannot be easily predicted if we follow standard autosegmental assumptions: since this framework assumes that all of the pitch accents have the same status, it offers no way to predict which pitch accent is going to associate to the text. The main goal of this article is to explore the implications of the Catalan compression data for the theory of tune-text association and the structure of pitch contours and to propose ways to modify standard autosegmental assumptions to accommodate the different compression strategies displayed by Catalan. It will be argued that the most convincing way to account for such contrasts has to rely on the postulation of a hierarchical structure for such tunes.},

It is shown that the well-formedness of rimes responded to constant pressure to obey emergent markedness criteria and evolved through repeated violations of faithfulness. Two specific issues are closely scrutinized: (1) the interaction that took place, in 4th-c. Gallo-Romance, between various types of yod and two general processes of the phonology of the time: diphthongization and voicing, and (2) the left to
right alignment shift within Old French diphthongs and triphthongs which gave to the reflex of former velar consonants full vocalic value and the structural properties of a nucleus head. Reranking of universal constraints, as it reflects perceptual enhancements, provides, together with appropriate stages of relexification, the main tool for an analysis of sound change.},

Utterances contained only voiced sounds, and the same ratio of high and low vowels. Speakers uttered each Phonological Utterance (PU) as three separate Intonation Phrases (IPs) corresponding to the NPs, PAs, and VPs. The final syllable of each phrase was realized with significantly more lengthening than syllables within the phrase, and pitch was scaled higher at the edges of than within major syntactic phrases. Silent pauses within the PU were optional. If occurred, they were only realized at the edges of PAs. These results support prosodic and non-linear syntactic representations of parentheticals as autonomous phrase structures within the utterance.},

complexity on intonational phrasing in Spanish and European Portuguese. 
Spanish presents a clear tendency to divide utterances into (S)(VO) phrasings, 
depending on branchingness. In EP (SVO) is the predominant phrasing, but a 
long branching subject can trigger the phrasing (S)(VO). The main differences 
between the two languages are analyzed as arising from two properties: the 
different syntactic position of subjects (external or internal to Extended VP) and 
the different parameters of prosodic weight (number of syllables vs. number of 
words/branchingness) realized by each language. Constraints of the syntax- 
prosody interface and prosodic constraints on the maximum size of major phrases 
refer to these properties and produce different outcomes. The preference shared 
by EP and Spanish to have the material in a VP contained in the same major 
phrase (disallowing (V)(O) phrasings) also stems from a syntax-phonology

	Abstract = {Post-lexical stress shift in English, as exemplified by FIFteen MEN (cf. 
fifTEEN or FIFTEEN) is sensitive to rhythm and constituency. Rhythm can be 
accounted for by constraints like NoClash, forbidding adjacent accents within the 
phonological phrase. Constituency has been accounted for by a cyclic application 
of right-alignment and left-alignment of accents in the phonological phrase. 
However, such an account fails to take care of multiply premodified NPs like 
Fifteen Japanese CDs. Ranking right-alignment above left-alignment gives 
fifTEEN japaNESE ceeDEES and the reverse ranking gives the equally 
unacceptable FIFteen JAPanese CEEdees. Abandoning a cyclic treatment, I 
propose a procliticized structure in which procliticized phonological phrases 
correspond to embedding premodifiers like fifteen in the above example. Such 
premodifiers align with the left edge with a phonological phrase but fail to align 
their right edge with a phonological phrase. As a result, the correct (FIFteen 
(JAPaNESE ceeDEES)) is produced, or, if NoClash is given a stricter 
interpretation so as to ban accents with only one unaccented syllable between 
them, the equally correct (FIFteen (JAPanese ceeDEES)). A systematic but 
hitherto unnoticed stress contrast is discussed, that between e.g. TOO high 
BUILdings and TWO HIGH BUILdings, and it is shown that the new account

constraints on the construction of phonological phrases (/- or p-phrases) in 
Catalan. It is shown that the construction of prosodic structure in this language 
cannot solely rely on syntactic information but rather also has to refer to prosodic 
markedness constraints which regulate the size and eurhythmicity of phrase 
constituents. Specifically, phonological phrasing in Catalan is determined, among 
other things, by the interaction of right-alignment of syntactic and phonological 
phrases (Align-XP,R; Selkirk 1986) and the requirement that each XP is 
contained in a p-phrase (Wrap-XP; Truckenbrodt 1995) together with the 
following set of prosodic factors: 1) a maximal requirement on the length of 
p-phrases at the end of utterances, Max-Bin-End, which requires that each 
p-phrase containing a nuclear stress should contain at most two prosodic 
words; 2) a minimality constraint on the prosodic parsing of utterances, Min-

phrase boundaries and syntax in production and comprehension. Watson &
Gibson (2004a) proposed that the likelihood of an intonational boundary at a
word boundary is a function of 1) the size of the most recently completed
constituent and 2) the size of the upcoming constituent if it is not an argument of
the most recent head. We explore an alternate hypothesis to (1): the distance of
integration between an upcoming word and its attachment site in the sentence
influences the likelihood of an intonational boundary. In a production experiment
(Experiment 1), we found that speakers  intonational phrasing patterns were
consistent with Watson & Gibson's original hypothesis. We then present two
studies of sentence comprehension using converging paradigms which test the
hypothesis that listeners exploit the relationship between syntax and the
production-based intonational boundaries by using a special parsing heuristic.
In particular, we propose that listeners prefer not to attach incoming words to
lexical heads that are followed by an intonational boundary. This hypothesis is
validated in both Experiments 2 and 3.},

@article{Samek-Lodovici:2005,
	Abstract = {Constraints on prosodic and syntactic well-formedness conflict with
each other. This is particularly evident in the expression of new information focus,
where the best prosodic position for main stress does not necessarily match the best
syntactic position for the constituent being focused. Since focus must be stressed,
either stress or the focused constituent must abandon their best position, violating
either the syntactic or the prosodic constraints responsible for it. This paper argues
for an optimality theoretic analysis of this conflict, showing how different focus
paradigms reflect different rankings of the relevant syntactic and prosodic constraints.
As we will see, only an optimality analysis can account for the paradigm of
Italian focus while maintaining the kind of prosodic theory of main stress emerged
from prosodic studies in the last two decades. Furthermore, the analysis extends
naturally to focus paradigms in English, French, and Chichewa with no need for
language-specific parametric devices. The conflicting nature of prosodic and syntactic
constraints determines a complex crosslinguistic typology from a single set of
universal constraints with interface conditions kept to an absolute minimum.},

assigned to specialized categorial features such as [V] and [N] is performed by

This view, along with the fact that agreement features come in bundles, leads to a
novel way of looking at verba subject agreement. Understood as the reflex of featurematching
and deletion, verba subject agreement is essentially a mechanism of categorization
by computation. It leads to deletion of the nominal agreement feature
from the verb and related functional heads and the verbal agreement feature from the
subject. Further empirical support for this way of looking at agreement comes from
the antiagreement phenomenon, which turns out to be a reflex of the peculiar categorial
identity of the predicate in relevant sentences. The examples used in the

the greater weight of low sonority onsets, and the subordination of onset-sensitive
weight distinctions to rime-based ones in languages with both types of weight distinctions.
Onset-based weight criteria are effectively modelled using a skeletal slot

heavy syllables be stressed and that light syllables be unstressed.},

proposal has consequences for Case theory and for checking theory in general. More

One set of studies examines the hypothesis that hte representation of elided material is syntactically structured. We present evidence supporting the hypothesis and tentatively attribute the effects to sharing of the sturcture of hte antecedent constituent, with structure building or substitution of a variable for a constituent permitted if it is licensed by the syntactic principles of the language. Another set of studies tests the hypothesis that a new utterance is preferentially related to the main assertion of the preceding utterace, which is typically a constituent high in the syntactic tree. Teh results suggest that discourse processing differs from syntacic processing, where the most accessible material is recent material found low int he synatctic tree. A final set of studies examines the interplay of the syntactic processor, which may not violate "islands," and the discourse processor, whch may, in the processing of ellipsis sentences involving islands. A novel explanation is offered for the observation (Ross 1967) that slucing out of relative clause islands is grammatical except when sprouting is required.},

	Abstract = {Reference set comutatoin --- the construction of a (global) comparison set to determine whether a given derivation is appropriate in context -- comes with a processing cost. I argue that this cost is directly visible at the acquisition stage: In those linguistic areas in which it has been independently established that such computation is indeed at work, experiments have consistently found group performance at the range of 50 percent (in dual-choice tasks). The proposed explanation is that children are aware of the innately required computation, but they cannot carry it out because of their limited working-memory resources, and they resort instead to strategies that enable bypassing it.\\ \\
Previous stides have extablished already the 50 percent range of performance in the acquisition of 2 areas requiring reference set compuatation -- coreference (Condition B) and implicatures. In this study, I examine the acquisition of stress shift and focus. I argue that compuating the focus obtained by stress shift requires constructing a comparison set. Contrary to some prevailing views, there is no evidence tha tchildren have general problems with stress, but still, one finds the 50 percent range of perfromance when stress shift applies as predicted by the processing cost hyptohesis. Analysis of the explanations children give for their answers has revelaed that they are attempting to construct the relevant comparison derivaiton, but they get stuck at that stage. Combined with the anlysis of individual responses, 2 bypassing strategies are found in this area: one is simple guessing, dominant in tasks involving switch reference with stress shift in whihc one finds individual performance at the range of 50 percent. The other, dominant in tasks involving semantic disambiguation, is the selection of an arbitrary default, which may be fixed for a given child across tasks. However, because the choice of the default is itself arbitrary, the group results remain at the 50 percent range.},

	Abstract = {Jayaseelan (1990) and Lasnik and Saito (1991) observe that English Gapping exhibits properties typical of rightward movement. In this paper, we address the question of why this is the case. We propose that in Gapping, a contrasted element in the full-fledged conjunct can move leftward or rightward to create a structure for copying and that illegitimate derivations are excluded by independently motivated constraints. As one such constraint, we adopt Saito's (1985) condition on adjunction sites, which requires that an element adjoin to the side of the category which is opposite to the head. Since Saito's constraint relies on the head parameter, this analysis makes the obvious prediction that Gapping constructions in head-final languages should involve leftward movement. We show that this is indeed the case with Japanese. The most important theoretical consequences are: (i) that the directionality of adjunction is constrained in LF in the same way as in overt syntax and (ii) that constraints such as the Right Roof constraint and the Subjacency Condition apply both in overt syntax and in LF. The other important consequence is that P-stranding is universally allowed at LF for leftward movement but not for rightward movement.},

The discussion is mainly based on English, Bulgarian, Czech and Chinese/Japanese, which instantiate four basic patterns of multiple question formation.

	Abstract = {The current work explores the issue of category in lexical ambiguity resolution. The central question is whether the preceding sentential context can influence access of lexical meaning in on-going sentence comprehension. Previous studies have concentrated on lexical ambiguity resolution of nouns. These studies, on teh whole, have demonstrated that the lexical access system operates independently of previous sentential context. However, previous psycholinguistic work on semantic change suggests that verbs are more susceptible to coercive change than nouns. I explore the possibility that this susceptibility of verbs to semantic change will allow sentential context to influence their lexical access. I find, instead, that the lexical access system still operates independently of preceding sentential context. Teh implications of this finding are presented in terms of two different views of cognitive processing -- the modular and the interactionist view.},

Some simple constraints on obviation provide interesting analyses of key facts in Algonquian. Once certain language-particular differences are recognized, a number of syntactici problems in two unrelated languages, Tzotzil (Mayan) and Chamorro (Western Austronesian), yield easily to solutions based on obviation, despite the absence of obviative-based morphology in either language. Hierarchy alignmnet constraints play a central role in the analysis. The account is articulated within optimality theory, which provides an appropriate framework for representing the fact that these languges must select from their resources for expressing transitive propositions the optimal mode of expression for each such proposition.},

	Abstract = {Among the most robust generalizations in syntactic markedness is the association of semantic role with person/animacy rank, discussed first in Silverstein (1976). The present paper explores how Silverstin's generalization might be expressed in a formal theory of grammar, and how it can play a role in individual grammars. The account, which focuses here on the role of person, is developed in Optimality Theory. Central to it are two formal devices which have been proposed in connection with phonology: harmonic alignment of prominence scales, and local conjunction of constraints. It is shown that application of harmonic alignment to scales involving syntactic relations and several substantive dimensions characterizes the universal markedness relations operative in this domain, and provides the constraints necessary for grammar construction. Differences between languages can be described as differences in the ranking of universal constraints.},

The distinction betwen root and affix faithfulness has been employed in the analysis of hte privileged status of roots in a variety of phonological systems, such as root-controlled vowel harmony. In this article, I argue that this distinction is equally important in explaining the observation in CupeA+-o that inherent accent in roots takes precedence over inherent accent in affixes. In addition, morphologically dispersed faithfulness is shown to be instrumental in extending the analysis beyond previous accounts, providing the right tools for the analysis of pre-accentuation and the special phonology of the nominalizer suffix.},

We investigate it within Optimality Theory, arguing that it falls into two distinct types, phonological and morphological. Phonoloigical fixed segmentism is analyzed under the OT rubric of emergence of the unmarked. It therefore has significant connections to markedness theoyr, sharing properties with other domains where markedness is relevant and showing context-dependence. In contrast, morphological fixed segmentism is a kid of affixation, and so it resembles affixign morphology generally, The two types are contrasted, and claims about impossible patterns of fixed segmentism are developed.},

	Abstract = {This paper undertakes an analysis of the word order characteristics of hentai kambun, the archaic Japanese writing style employed for recording Japanese in a way that outwardly resembles Chinese. AS a method of writing Japanese, however, hentai kambun differs conspicuously from standard classical Chinese. Traditional accounts of these deviations tend to treat them as random mistakes in Chinese grammar due to influence from the writer's native Japanese. In contrast to this, the current paper views hentai kambun as a systematic representation of Japanese, rather than as an imitation of Chinese. Specifically, I propose that hentai kambun word order can recieve a systematic account by assuming that Japanese has underlying head-initial word order, as proposed by Kayne (1994) and Whitman (2000), and that hentai kambun is a represenation of this underlying order. This paper further investigates word order in ditransitive clauses and finds that the hentai kambun represenation of dative-accusative and accusative-dative word order alternation provides evidence that what is traditionally referred to as "short scrambling" can in fact be analyzed as base-generation, as proposed in Miyagawa (1997).},

The empirical domain consists of constructions where subject movement is not required for reasons that have to do with the Extended Projection Principle. In these environments and whenever a sentence contains both a subject and a direct object, one of the arguments must vacate the VP. We argue that argument externalization is related to Case. It is forced because movement of both arguments to a single head To that contains two active Case features in the covert componenet is banned.},

	Abstract = {The paper investigates a number of asymmetries in the behavior of subjects in Germanic, Celtic/Arabic, Romance, and Greek. The langauges under investigation divide into two main groups with respect to a cluster of properties, including the availability of pro-drop with referential subjects, the possibility of VSO/VOS orders, the A/A' status of subjects in SVO orders, the presence/absence of Definiteness Restriction (DR)-effects in unaccusative constructions, the existence of verb-raising independently of V-2, and others. We argue that the key factor in this split is a parametrization in the way the Extended Projection Principle (EPP) is checked: move/merge XP vs. move/merge Xo. The fist option is taken in Germanic, the second in Celtic, Greek, and Romance. According to our proposal, the EPP relates to checking of a nominal feature of AGR (cf. Chomsky 1995), and move/merge Xo languages satsify the EPP via V-raising, as their verbal agreement morphology includes the requisite nominal feature (cf. Taraldsen 1978). Moreover, we demonstrate that the further differences that exist between Celtic/Arabic on the one hand and Romance/Greek on the other are related to the parametric availability of Spec, TP for subjects (cf. Jonas and Bobljik 1993, Bobaljik and Jonas 1996). In Celtic and Arabic, Spec, TP for subjects is licensed, resulting in VSO orders with VP external subjects. IN Greek and Romance, Spec, TP is not licensed, resulting in 'subject inverted' orders with VP internal subjects. In other words, we show that within the class of move/merge Xo languages, a further partition emerges which is due to the same parameter divding Germanic langauges into two major classes. We demonstrate that combining the proposed EPP/AGR parameter with the Spec, TP parameter gives four language-types with distinct properties.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the question whether the type of passive that a language has is or is not related to apparently independent properties of the language, such as object marking, found in Bantu languages. The theory of object asymmetries (Baker, 1988a; Bresnan and Moshi, 1990) makes the fundamental claim that passive types are just one of the possible manifestations of an underlying asymmetry among objects. I argue that facts that might be taken as evidence against this claim turn out to have an analysis that is consistent with it and thus preserves important predictions made by the theory of object asymmetries. The analysis of these and other facts that reveal asymmetries among objects supports the assumption that the theory of object asymmetries relies heavily on a level of representation in which arguments are ranked by prominence, as determined by their thematic roles. The conclusion that an adequate theory must view the type of passive not as a property of the passive morpheme (contra Woolford, 1993), but as a manifestation of an underlying feature of the language, argues against the view that requries parameters to be morpheme-based: at least in some cases, paramters must be language-based.},

In Optimality Theory, two types of solutions have been porposed: morphologically specialized phonological constraints (interface constraints) and different constraint rankings for different morphological categories (cophonologies). This paper presents empirical evidence that distinguishes between these two hypthoeses. Stem-final vowel alternations in Finnish are governed by a mixed set of conditions that range from purely phonological to morphological and lexical, from iron-clad exceptionless regularities to quantitative tendencies. Using a standard distionary as the data base, we show that phonolgical conditioning plays the dominant role, but in cases where phonology underdetermines the output, morphological conditioning may emerge. We then show that partial ordering of constraints, commonly used to model variation, extends to morphological conditioning as well. The partial ordering model is a restrictive version of the cphonology model, which is thus supported.},

Based on this generalization, we argue that epithet phrases are not intrinsically pronominal. Rather, it is the anaphoric pronominal element which occurs with those epithet phrases that accounts for their pronominal behavior. We discuss the cross-linguistic consequences of this claim by examining the behavior of epithet phrases in a language, Moroccan Arabic, where epithet phrases cannot be used anaphorically as bound variables or as resumptive elements. Furthermore, the distribution of epithet phrases is regulated by a constraint htat prevents these elements from being linked to the most local operator. This restriction is responsible for the limited distribution of resumptive epithet phrases, and its effects could mislead one into assuming that epithet phrses cannot be used as resumptive elements.},

As resumptives, strong pronouns and epithet phrases cannot be related to a quantificational antecedent unless they occur inside islands. We account for this Obviation Requirement as follwos: (a) (true) resumption is a last resort device, (b) strong pronouns and epithet phrases in apparent resumption contexts are generated as appositive modifiers of a DP, which is fronted to an A'-position, and (c) appositive modifiers are interpreted as independent clauses. Obviation is reduced to the inability of quantifiers to bind a pronominal element across sentential boundaries.},

For each language we found a pervasive restriction that is responsible for the missing cominations: german has closing suffixes, which individually prevent further suffixation. English allows only one Germanic suffix per word. In both languages the restriction holds for inflection and for clitics as well. For German, we also found that all closing suffixes are followed by linking elements in compounds, and that this constitutes the major productive use of linking elements. for English, we also found that Latinate suffixes are much more susceptible to combination, so that the Germanic and Latinate suffixes follow complementary patterns. Our findings for English show that the often-repeated observation that English inflectional morphology is simpler than that of related languages extends to derivation as well.},

I argue for a more articulated theory of the syntax-semantics interface, one which recognizes the ability of BOCs such as referential disjointness conditions to make reference to semantic information from two distinct sources, one of which uses lexically encoded material known as conventional implicature or semantic presupposition. This hypoothesis accounts for why lexical elements such as even, only, emphatic anaphors, etc. seem to allow the nominal elements which they focus to freely violate the well-known disjointness requirements known as Condition B, Condition C and Weak Crossover. It also leads to the conclusion that Condition A is not a BOC and that proposals which attempt to derive its effects from movement constraints internal to the computational system are probably on the right track.},

First, interpretive constraints which use information form the computational system take precedence over those which do not. Second, the principles of economy which regulate grammatical operations in the computational component appear to extend beyond LF. The first conclusion would seem to indicate that the idea that syntax is autonomous is on the right track. That is, at least in the case discussed, it would seem that the output of the computational system is not influenced by the cognitive systems which access its interface representations; in fact, quite the opposite. The second conclusion, on the other hand, would seem to argue for an integrated model of grammar in which each module, computational or representational, is subject to similar economy conditions and is therefore as much part of grammatical theory as the other.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines the chameleon-like coreference properties of one use of the French nominal element ce and shows that this element is subject to different noncoreference constraints depending on the quantificational status of its antecedent. Based on previous observations made by Aoun (1986) regarding the binding properties of overt pronouns in a dialect of Mandarin Chinese, it is argued that elements which obey a "split binding condition," such as French ce, are not restricted to one language. An analysis of these facts is proposed in terms of iterpretive strategies at LF stemming from the use languages make of typing particles in Co. This analysis has the advantage of providing adequate empirical coverage while preserving the cross-linguistic/cross-dialectal universality of Binding Theory. It also raises new prospects for Chomsky's (1995) Minimalist approach to grammatical theory.},

	Abstract = {Subjunctive cluases of many Romance and Slavic languages show subject obviation phenomena; that is, the requirement that a pronominal subject of a subjunctive clause be disjoint in reference from the matrix subject. Most of the previous explanations of the phenomenon stipulated that the anaphoric nature of subjunctive Tense leads to an extension of the binding domain of the subject pronoun to include the matrix clause, thus leading to the pronoun being locally bound in violation of Principle B. Using evidence from Russian, we show that the domain extension approaches cannot be correct. We argue for an analysis in which the subjunctive Complementizer is an operator which moves at LF to bind the events of the matrix and the subjunctive cluases. The resulting configuration creates a violation of Principle B with respect to the subjunctive AgrS which is coindexed with the subjunctive subject. Our approach can explain all of the known facts and makes strong cross-linguistic predictions that we show to be correct.},

We show that although Russian children know the porperties oft he construction, they have notable difficulty using it with unaccusative verbs. Since the input evidence for genitive of negation with unaccusative verbs is quite robust, we interpret our results as support for the hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of null arguments across languages has been accounted for in terms of two distinct strategies: licensing by agreement and licensing by topic. Lillo-Martin (1986, 1991) claims that American Sign Language (ASL) exploits both strategies for licensing null arguments, depending on the morphological characteristics of the verb. Here we show that this is incorrect. Once the nonmanual correlates of agreement features (comparable to the nonmanual expressions of other syntactic features) in ASL are recognized, it becomes apparent that null argument in this language are systematically licnesed by an expression of syntactic agreement.},

I present evidence from Russian of scope and antireconstruction effects and scrambling/wh-movement parallels, all implicating a "classical" overt movement account of A'-scrambling. I then discuss theoretical issues unresolved by the base generation/lowering account. Having shown that A'-scrambling is (upward) movement, I argue that the accout of A-scrambled arguments as base-generated also loses its force. In conclusion I suggest an alternative way to eliminate the apparent optionality associated with scrambling, while maintaining the classical analysis of scrambling as upward movement.},

@article{Baker:1997a,
	Abstract = {This article argues that the mood morphemes found on punctual verbs in Mohawk are to be analyzed semantically as markers of verbal definiteness/specificity. In particular, the so-called future marker is an indefinite morpheme, indicating that the event argument of the verb undergoes Heim's (1982) rule of Quantifier Indexing. In contrast, the seeming past marker is a marker of definiteness/specificity, indicating that the event argument is immune to Quantifier Indexing. This explains many apparent peculiarities of the Mohawk verbal system, including: the use of "future" as a past habitual form, the use of mood prefixes in conditionals, free relatives, and complement clauses, and the incompatibility of "past" with negation. The relationship between indefinite mood and future events, where it exists, is explicated in terms of the branching theory of time proposed by Dowty (1979) and Kamp and Reyle (1993), which is grounded in a fundamental asymmetry in how humans conceive of the future versus the past.},

	Abstract = {This paper offers an explanation for a little-known but striking phenomenon first discussed by Jackendoff (1968b) that I will call ANTI-UNIQUENESS: partitives are incompatible with the definite determiner (*I met the one of John's friends), unless the partitive first receives additional modification (I met the [ [one of John's friends] that he traveled with from Mexico]). I argue that an independently needed refinement of the semantic analyses of the partitive of Ladusaw (1982) and Hoeksema (1984) automatically predicts these anti-uniqueness facts. More specifically, I propose that partivitiy is always propoer partivity. This will guarantee that any property denoted by a partitive will have at least two entities in its extension, and cannot uniquely identify an individual; thus partitives are anti-unique. In addition, this paper makes a new case for analyzing double genitives as partitives. A number of syntactic and semantic arguments will show that, despite appearances, so-called double genitives (a friend of John's) have less in common with a superficially quite similar type of simple genitive (a friend of John) than with standard partitives (one of John's friends). If double genitives are indeed a type of partitive, this explains why they also exhibit anti-uniqueness effects: *I met [the friend of John's] is bad but I met the [[ friend of John's] that he traveled with from Mexico] is perfect fine.},

This positioning of the direct object/indirect object is seen in the context of the thetic/categorical distinction in predication involving the inner subject (the direct object and the inner predicate (the verb plus any complements).},

It can be applied to a variety of linguistic data from typologically different languages. A Deictic Structure (DS) is the deep structure of a clause.

Language-specific linear ordering rules apply to the Verb and Deictics of the DS. A lexically explicit, syntactically complex phrase or clause can be substituted in Surface Structure for a Deictic from the DS. The Deictic or a phonetically null PRO may appear in SS.

Evidence comes from a number of wh-in-situ constructions in German, such as the scope-marking construction and multiple questions. For semantic reasons, the in situ element in those constructions has to move at LF to either a position reserved for wh-phrases, or even higher up in the structure. The restriction (the Minimal Quantified Structure Cosntraint, MQSC) is that an intervening quantified expression blocks this movement. In the case of every, the MQSC leads to an unambiguously ditributive interpretation of the question. In the case of all other intervening operators, including negation, it leads to ungrammaticality.},

Interpretational possibilities of reciprocal sentences that have been discussed in the literature are identified as one of these four. A compositional semantic analysis of all of these readings is provided in which the reciprocal expression is uniformly represented as 'the other ones among them' (recasting Heim, Lasnik and May 1991a,b). A reciprocal sentenc is thus a special kind of relational plural. Interpretational variability comes about by the same mechanisms of plural predication at work in relational plurals: pluralization operators, LF operations like QR, and addition of contextual information.},

This is related to the observation that in German, a wh-phase must not be c-commanded by negation or a negative quantifier. We suggest that both languages are sensitive to a restriction that prohibits LF movement across negation, the Minimal Negative Structure Constraint MNSC, proposed in Beck (1996). Since a negative polarity item must always be in the scope of negation, the MNSC covers the Korean data as well as the German facts. Our analysis has several interesting implications for LFstructures in Korean. One is that negation cannot be interpreted in its S-structure position. Another concerns the semantic effect of scrambling. Contra Saito (1989; 1992), we argue that scrambling serves to identify intended relative scope and is thus by no means vacuous. We propose that short scrambling is never reconstructed.},

	Abstract = {A semantics for interrogatives is presented which is based on Karttunen's theory, but in a flexible manner incorporates both weak and strong exhaustivity. The paper starts out by considering degree questions, which often require an answer picking out the maximal degree from a certain set. However, in some cases, depending on the semantic properties of the question predicate, reference to the minimal degree is required, or neither specifying the maximum nor the minimum is sufficient. What is needed is an operation which defines the maximally informative answer on the basis of the Karttunen question denotation. Shifting attention to non-degree questions, two notions of answerhood are adopted from work by Heim. The first of these is weakly exhaustive adn the second strongly enhaustive. The second notion of answerhood is proven to be equivalent to Groenendijk adn Stokhof's interrogative semantics. On the basis of a wide range of empirical data showing that questions often are not interpreted exhaustively, it is argued that a fairly rich system of semantic objects associated with questions is needed to account for hte various ways in which questions contribute to the semantics and pragmatics of the utterances in which they appear.},

It explores various asymmetris that arise in the context of the interaction between NPIs and the licensing negative head. These asymmetries raise various important issues that go to the heart of current syntactic debates concerning the appropriate syntactic configurations where certain syntactic relations must obtain. It is shown that the NPI hetta + NP 'any NP' must be either c-commanded by or in overt Spec-head relation with the negative head ma 'not' within the same clause. We explore hypotheses that dispense with this disjunction, such as overt M-command or Spec-head agreement plus LF movement. Finally, we show, on the basis of various arguments from reconstruction and locality, that such a reduction is not empirically viable.},

On the contrary, I argue on the basis of evidence from reconstruction, Case, and agreement that the two patterrns are radically different. In the Q_NP pattern Q is indeed the head of a QP projection that contains the NP. In the NP_Q pattern, however, Q heads a QP adjunct that modifies the NP and in some cases the VP.},

	Abstract = {The main theoretical subject of this paper is the symmetry between nominal and verbal projections. It is demonstrated that predication exists in the nominal domain, in a way quite similar to predication in the clausal domain. An analysis of predication in a configurational way -- such that the subject adn the predicate together constitute a small clause -- makes it possible to provide detailed analyses of complex nominal constructions involving predication, and predicate inversion in particular. This paper focusses on three construction types from Dutch: the N-VAN-EEN-N construction (EEN BEER VAN EEN KEREL 'a bear of a guy'), the WAT-VOOR construction (WAT VOOR EEN KEREL 'what kind of guy'), and the WAT-EEN exclamative (WAT EEN KEREL 'what a guy'). Another aspect of symmetry concerns the fact that the nature of the functional projections in the nominal domain is not significantly different from that of functional projections in teh clausal domain. For instance, it is argued that copular elements and complementisers are not peculiar to clausal domain, but that these are found in the nominal domain as well.},

	Abstract = {The study reported in this paper appeals to data from agrammatic aphasia to confront two competing analyses of the derivation of postverbal subjects in languages which permit free inversion. IN one of hte analyses, postverbal subjects are derived by movement, while in the other, they are base-generated in situ.
According to a prominent hypothesis which attempts to explain the pattern of sparing and loss in agrammatism in terms of current linguistic theory, the only syntactic deficit is the loss of trace. This movement-derived 'trace-deletion' hypothesis has been successful in predicting what agrammatics can and cannot comprehend. In the present study, these predictions are first of all confirmed for Spanish-speaking agrammatics on a range of structures for which predictions are identical under both movement and non-movement analyses. These structures serve as a control, establishing that the claims of the trace-deletion hypothesis are valid. They pave the way for the critical test of the VS passive, the only structure for which the competing analyses yield different predictions. Agrammatic data on the VS passive are used to adjudicate between the competing analyses. Since agrammatic subjects perform randomly on VS passives, it is concluded that the postverbal subject is derived by movement.},

Spanish speakers who scan their conceptual representation to find the target word recognize it more slowly in unaccusative-verb sentences: this may indicate that the conceptual representation of unaccusatives is more complex than that of unergatives.

	Abstract = {Crosslinguistically, causative constructions conform to the following generalization: If the causal relation is syntactically concealed, then it is semantically direct. Concealed causatives span a wide syntactic spectrum, ranging from resultative complements in English to causative subjects in Mikitu. A unified type-driven theory is proposed which attributes the understood causal relation -- and other elements of constructional meaning -- to type lifting operations predictably licensed by type mismatch at LF. The proposal has far-reaching theoretical implications not only for the theory of compositionality and causation, but also for the underlying theory of events, space, and time in natural language discourse.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops an argument forthe copy theory of movement based on consideration of Holmberg's Generalization, a well-documentted constraint on object shift in the Germanic languages. A particular formulation of HG is presented, tying it to verb movement, and this is defended against the alternative formulation presented in Holmberg (1999). It is argued that HG is the result of a morphophonological constraint on verb inflection, requiring merger under PF-adjacency, support for which comes from differences between VO and OV langauges. The account of HG is related to PF-merger proposals for do-support, and a theory of adverb ordering within the Spell Out component is sketched, accounting for the apparent invisibility of adverbs, problematic on earlier approaches. On the standard model, the characterization of HG presented here requires invocation of a PF filter; the copy theory permits an alternative with more local evaluation. By treating the overt/covert distinction as an effect of whcih copy is pronounced, the copy theory allows satisfaction of the PF adjacency constraint for merger to be a PF matter. Moving to a model in which both LF and PF ahve the ability to privilege either the higher or lower position in a non-trivial chain predicts the existence of a range of phenomena in with the lower position is privileged by both LF and PF. It is argued that such phenomena are attested, and further implications of the copy theory are explored.},

Assuming that the inventory of functional projections dominating VP is not universal (e.b., the presence of Agr-PHrases is a point of parametric variation) current assumptions about locality predict obligatory verb raising in a langauge with Agr-Phrases, but obligatory V in situ in a simple IP-VP configuration. We predict a correlation with other morpho-syntactic phenomena reflecting the presence/absence of AgrPs: "extra" subject and object positions, transitive expletive constructions, multiple inflectional affixes, etc. This prediction is borne out for the VO Germanic languages; for the OV languages we predict the existence of head-final Infl projections.},

It argues that A-moving quantifiers do not usually exhibit reconstruction effects because arguments are interpreted in the position where their uninterpretable Case feature is erased. It shows how the Case-checking condition on scope taking can be obviated in the case of indefinites by means of covert insertion of an expletive, and goes on to provide arguments that lowered readings of indefinites involve literal lowering. This movement is subject to Relativized Minimality, thereby further supporting the claim that Quantifier Movement is a syntactic operation. The paper considers the possibility that such an account can be reconciled with the idea that copies left by A-movement necessarily delete, and argues that this is possible only if hte derivational character of syntax is strengthened.},

We argue that the Gradual Learning Algorithm has a number of special advantages: it can learn free variation, deal effectively with noisy learning data, and account for gradient well-formedness judgments.

One of its implicaitons is that there are no right-adjunction structures, either base-generated or derived. Among other things, this means that traditional analyses of relative clauses must be rejected. Kayne proposes an alternative analysis, in which teh "head" is raised out of the relative clause. The analysis faces a variety of problems and needs numerous additional mechanisms to achieve observational adquacy. Thus, it seems that relative clauses cast serious doubt on Kayne's theory.},

Our analysis rests on the assumption that the mapping between argument structure and valence is defined by realization constraints which are satisfied by all lexical heads. Arguments can be realized as local dependents, in whcih case they are selected via the head's valence features. Alternatively, arguments may be realized in a long-distance dependency construction, in which case they are selected via the head's SLASH features. Furthermore, we argue that English post-verbal adjuncts, as well as complements, are syntactic dependents selected by the verb, thus providing a uniform analysis of complement and adjunct extractionj. Finally, we show that our analysis provides an alternative treatment of subject extraction and we offer a new account of the that-trace effect.},

MWFL differ from English, Chinese, and French in that in MWFL even wh-phrases that do not undergo wh-movement still must front for an independent reason, argued to involve focus. The fronting has several exceptions (semantic, phonological, and syntactic in nature), explanation for which leads me to posit a new type of in-situ wh-phrase and argue for the possibility of pronunciation of lower copies of chains.},

In this article we propose a new analysis of scrambling that puts scrambling in conformity with the Last Resort principle. We argue that scrambled elements are base-generated in their surface non-theta-positions and undergo obligatory LF movement to the position where they receive theta-roles, which we consider to be formal features capable of driving movement.

This article presents a system of principles relating (L)LF representations and lexical items that aims to be compatible with this assumption. The core of this theory is that phrase structures are viewed as projection lines (lexical items and their projections) linked by an Insert relation. This explains uniqueness and locality of projection, the fact that phrases and nonphrasal elements can immediately dominate each other only when they are part of the same projection line, and most effects of the "target projects" requirement. I attribute a residue to the Generalized Projection Principle, for which I also provide an explanation. In addition, I explore various consequences of the present approach for the Move/Chain relation.},

The core hypothesis of this theory is that in syntactic representations complementation expresses morphological structure: X is the complement of Y only if Y-X form a morphological unit -- a word. A second central assumption is the elimination of phrasal projection: a head X in a syntactic tree should be taken to ambiguously represent both the zero-level head(s) and its (their) associated phrasal node(s).},

I adopt the derivation-and-evaluation model of grammar, according to which Chomsky's compuatational system (CHL) functions as a generator which produces candidates that are evaluated in an optimality theoretic manner, and it is shown that the strong/weak distinction can be captured by assuming an interaction between a constraint that disfavors movement (STAY) and a constraint (family) F that requires checking of the formal features. The discussion of Scandinavian Object Shift shows that this is not just a reformulation of the original distinction, but has various desirable empirical consequences. The article concludes with a discussion of Scrambling of the Dutch/German type.},

Nevertheless, frozen scope is not absolute, holding only between two objects but not between an object and a subject or an object and some other operator. The rigidity of two object quantifiers follows the pattern of multiple instances of movement crosslinguistically (multiple wh-movement, multiplie A-scrambling, multiple object shift): movement paths cross, reccreating the hierarchical order of the moving elements (Richards 1997). Hypothesizing that quantifier scope is derived by quantifier-specific syntactic movement, movement that is constrained in the same way as other types of movement, permits these phenomena to be unified under accounts of Relativized Minimality effects generally.},

@article{Buanmu:1999,
	Abstract = {A well-known problem in Chinese phonology is that in some dialects most regular syllables keep their underlying tones, but in others the initial syllable determines the tonal pattern of a multisyllabic domain. Mandarin and Shanghai, two of the most studied dialects, best represent the contrast. Duanmu (1993) proposes that the two dialects differ in syllable structure but otherwise obey the same phonological constraints, including moraic trochee. However, a number of problems remain, such as questions regarding the metrical counting units, the precited weight of a syllable and its phonetic duration, the economy of underlying tones, the mechanism of tone deletion, and the relation between weight and stress. This article offers a solution to the problems. The main proposal is that Chinese is both mora-counting and syllable-counting, in that a heavy syllable forms a bimoraic trochee, which I call M-foot, yet a minimal word must be a disyllabic trochee, which I call a S-foot. In addition, both Madnarin adn Shanghai are subject to toanl polarity, which is independently found in African languages. I also discuss the implication of the S-foot for metrical theory and other consequences of the present analysis.},

Such analyses are empirically inadequate, failing to account for secondary stress, and theoretically problematic, using ad hoc rules to produce the necessary effects. The analysis presented here uses alignment in Optimality Theory to generate the basic stress pattern and two well-motivated constraints, ONSET and *CLASH, to account for stress shift in a natural way.},

I propose that ouputs must be related not only to inputs, but to other, "neighboring" representations as well -- a feature that is shared by both the output-to-ouput faithfulness approach and the theory of targeted constraints developed by Wilson (2000, to appear). I show that all the cases cited by Rubach that seem to support derivations are in fact handled by the latter two related theories, and that both of these have significant advantages over derivations.},

It provides evidence in favor of distinguishing two types of asymmetry in coordination: the first type involves structural asymmetry (i.e. c-command asymmetry between conjuncts) and the second type structural-relations asymmetry (i.e. asymmetry with respect to feature-checking configurations). Using evidence from conjunction of temporal elements in Spanish, the paper argues that asymmetry in grammatical relations is not tenable, although structural asymmetry must be maintained. A structure that respects both conclusions is proposed, where conjuncts have the same relation with respect to feature-checking heads and still display asymmetric c-command relations with respect to each other.},

However, languages like Spanish show agreement between the extracted subject and the verb; Ouhalla attributes this, not the the presence of a resumptive pro, but to the lack of short movement of wh-subjects in the syntax. I show that Ouhalla's predictions are wrong regarding Spanish and Fiorentino; that subject extraction in these langauges (and in Galegan, Italian and Piedmontese) proceeds from postverbal position in both embedded and main clauses; and that the antiagreement effect results from the different nature of the expletive subjects licensed in these languages.},

We argue that generic passages whould be analyzed as sequences of generic sentences, each sentence containing itw own GEN operator (Krifka et al. 1995). The GEN operators produce tripartitie matrix/restrictor structures; the main discourse connection among the sentences is that the restrictor produced by each sentence in sequence has as its contents the information in the matrix produced by the previous sentence in the discourse. We also argue that an identity of reference times is required for this process to occur. In the end generic passages are a natural product of the interatction of generic operators in sentences with independently-established principles structuring ordinary extensional narrative.},

As a result of limited morphotactic space, in several contexts certain markers surface while others that are equally semantically motivated do not. Inflectional blocking, relying on general linguistic principles of specificity and analogy, accounts for surface verb forms in a novel, explanatory fashion. The implication for Georgian is that instead of employing inflection produced by syntactically relevant affixation rules, its verb morphology results from morphtactic constraints, blocking of potential affix combinations, and verb stem insertion into instantiated inflectional affix frames.},

In addition, every conjunct may control past particple agreement: masculine plural and feminine plural conjuncts may resolve as masculine plural, and singular and plural conjuncts may resolve as plural (pure gender and mixed number resolution, respectively). The resolution of mulitple signular conjuncts as plural, however, is rare, attested only once. While the control of agreement by the closest conjunct is the norm, pre-targe first conjuncts, regardless of their gender adn number, may trigger agreement as well. On the other hand, there is no clear textual evidence that pre-target middle conjuncts or post-target remote conjuncts control agreement. Hence, these observations admit the following generalization (taking first conjuncts to be underlying closest conjuncts): the only individual conjunct capable of controlling object-participle agreement is an (underlying) closest conjunct.},

ASsuming Kayne's (1994, 1998) proposal for APs, the problem can be partially overcome, but inflected 'of' constructions still lack an account. Chomsky's (1998) probe-goal approach applied to concord also encounters difficulties, avoided under revision of the (1995) system: if the phi-features of APs and KPs drive them to raise for checking, correct results are obtained.},

	Abstract = {Among the common strategies for eliminating vocalic hiatus is vowel elision. In some cases, it is the first vowel (V1) that elides, while in others it is the second (V2). Analyses of elision have, virtually without exception, simply stipulated which vowel is elided, for example, by encoding this information directly in a langauge-specific rule. This implies that the targeted position is not predictable, but simply a matter of which of two equally available options is selected by the language. A cross-linguistic study suggests, however, that this is not strictly the case, but that in some environments the choice of target is universally determined. This article accounts for the observed restrictions on elision target within a constraint-based theory which claims that langauges preferentially preserve phonological elements in certain prominent positions.},

Burzio's unaccusative analysis of the Italian auxiliary phenomenon is ad hoc with respect to the selection of essere with si-impersonal and fails to account for the occurrence of verbs such as correre 'to run' with both essere and avere. Also earlier semantic descriptions of the phenomenon cannot account for the occurrence of essere with si-constructions, and do not provide independent criteria to attribute semantic structures to verbs and semantic roles to arguments.},

	Abstract = {The specific referential renjia 'people-home' cannot be analyzed simply as a contra-reference code in contrast with a co-reference code, namnely, the Mandarin Chinese reflexive ziji 'self', as suggested in R. Cheng (1989: 1993). We believe that all the phenomena shown by the specific referential renjia 'people-home' fall under the notion of sympthetic antilogophoricity. That is, whenever the speaker attempts to appeal to the addressee's sympathy (or agreement) in his (or her) thoughts or feel, he/she usually uses the specific referental renjia 'people-home' and has it take as reference some identifiable or unidentifiable external protagonist(s) other than the speaker or the addressee, or someone who plays a pragmatically downgraded logphoric role in teh discourse, namely the downgraded speaker or addressee. CAses involving either a speaker-reference or an addressee-reference can be regarded as an extension of core sympathetic antilogophoricity, which is limited to cases of reference to an external protagonist other than the speaker or the addressee. Only in a non-core case of sympathetic antilogophoricity is it a necessary property of the sympathetic antilogophor renjia 'people-home' that its antecedent denotes an individual consceious of the relevant even tbeing reported. The differences between the specific referential renjia 'people-home' and English epithets (i.e., antilogophors) lead to our claim: there exist at least two types of antilogophors and the notion of sympathy plays an important role in interpreting some type of antilogophors.},

	Abstract = {This paper is devoted to the study of bare nominal arguments (i.e. determinerless NPs occurring in canonical argumental positions) from a crosslinguistic point of view. It is proposed that languages may vary in what they let their NPs denote. In some languages (like Chinese), NPs are argumental (names of kinds) and can thus occur freely without determiner in argument position; in others they are predicates (Romance), and this prevents NPs from occurring as arguments, unless the category D(eterminer) is projected. Finally, there are langauges (like Germanic or Slavic) which allow bothpredicative and argumental NPs; these languages, being the 'union' of the previous two types, are expected to behave like Romance for certain aspects of their nominal system (the singular count portion) and like Chinese for others (the mass and plural portions). This hypothesis (the 'Nominal Mapping Parameter') is investigated not just through typological considerations, but also through a detailed constrastive analysis of bare arguments in Germanic (English) vs. Romance (Italian). Some general consequences of this view, which posits a limited variation in the mapping form syntax into semantics, for current theories of Universal Grammar and acquisition are considered.},

	Abstract = {Spanish verbs display two past-tense forms, the pret{\'e}rito and the imperfecto. We offer an account of the semantics of these forms within a situation semantics, addressing a number of theoretically interesting questions about how to realize a semantics for tense and events in that type of framework. We argue that each of these forms is unambiguous, and that the apparent variety of readings attested for them derives from interaction with other factors in the course o finterpretation. The meaning of the imperfecto is constrained to always reflect atelic aktionsart. In addition, it contains a modal element, and a contextually-given accessibility relation over situations constrains the interpretation of the modal in ways that give rise to all the attested readings. The pret{\'e}rito is indeterminate with respect to aktionsart, neither telic nor atelic. One or the other aktionsart may be forced by other factors in the clause in which the pret{\'e}rito occurs, as well as by pragmatic contrast with the possibility of using the imperfecto.},

They may be true even in the absence of any supporting instances, and extending the size of their domain does not change their truth conditions. Generics and frequency statements are parametric on time, but not on pssible worlds; they cannot be applied to temporary generalizations, and yet are contingent. These constructions require a regular distribution of events along the time axis. Truth judgments of generics vary considerably across speakers, whereas truth judgments of frequency statements are much more uniform. A generic may be false even if the vast majority of individuals in its domain satisfy the predicated property, whereas a frequency statement using, e.g., usuallywould be true. This paper argues that all these seeminly unrelated puzzles have a single underlying cause: generics and frequency statements express probability judgments, and these, in turn, are interpreted as statements of hypothetical relative frequency.},

	Abstract = {In addition to the familiar cardinal and proportional readings of many and few, there is yet another interpretation, the relative proportional reading. This reading, unlike the ordinary absolute proportional reading, is not conservative. Under teh relative reading, 'many phis are psis' is true just in case the porportion of psis among phis is greater than the proportion of psis among members of contextually given alternatives to phi. I proide a definition of proportional readings that reduces the differences between absolute and relative interpretations to the value of a single parameter.
I argue that relative readings are not restricted to many and few, but are also exhibited by the adverbs often and seldom, and by generics. Interpretations of determiners that have been treated as "focus-affected readings," interpretations of adverbs of quantification that have been treated as "pure frequency readings," and interpretations of generics which have been claimed to be cases of "revers interpretation" or "direct kind predication" are, in fact, instances of relative readings.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we show that focus structure determines the interpretation of bare plurals in English: topic bare plurals are interpreted generically, focused bare plurals are interpreted existentially. When bare plurals are topics they must be specific, i.e. they refer to kinds. After type-shifting they introduce variables which can be bound by the generic quantifier, yielding characterizing generics. Existentially interpreted bare plurals are not variables, but denote properties that are incorporated into the predicate. They type of predicate determines the interpretation of its bare plural subject. The individual/stage-level distinction, though important, is not sufficient: since only arguments can be topics, only those stage-level predicates which have locative arguments can have existential bare plural subjects. Certain verbs (e.g., \emph{hate}) fail to incorporate their bare plural objects; therefore no existential reading of the object is available. We provide a novel solution to this puzzle based on the following two claims: (i) incorporated bare plurals do not introduce discourse referents; (ii) nonincorporating verbs are presuppositional.},

We argue that the apparent optionality seen in Malay reduces to whether, in the lexicon, a question word consists of an operator and variable combined in a single word, or of a variable bound by a separate, phonologically null operator. We then apply the analysis based on Malay to other langauges (primarily, to Chinese and English), and show that the principles employed for Malay are sufficient to explain the variation in wh-question formation among these languages.},

The varieties of Y/N questions which we shall describe are A-Not-A questions, questions employing the question particle ka and postposed negative auxiliary (PNA) questions.
The three types of Y/N questions can be reduced to two types, A-Not-A questions and ka questions. These two types of questions differ markedly in their propoerties. Ka questions show distributional limitations which indicate that they are derived similarly to adverbial WH questions, suggesting a movement analysis like that proposed by Huang (1982 and 1991) for Mandarin and Taiwanese A-Not-A questions. ST A-Not-A quesitons, however, appear not to be derived by movement. Rather, we follow McCawley's suggestion that A-Not-A questions represent the conventionalization and grammaticization of what earlier were not Y/N questions, but rather alternative or disjunctive questions.},

This structure is analysed in a minimalist framework, leading to a revision of the minimialist theory of locality constraints on movement.
Evidence is presented to show that the subject remains in Spec-V and the verb raises to Agro in quotative inversion sentences. The direct speech constituent at the periphery of the clause is shown to control an empty operator which triggers the inversion in a manner parallel to French stylistic inversion. The inversion is derived from the checking theory by supposing a particular complementiser type which then selects weak N-features on its complement. A transitivity constraint on quotative inversion is discussed and the Minimal Link Condition is reformulated so that inversion is blocked in VPs in which there is both a quote and a DP complement. Finally, the position of the verb in quotative inversion is derived from the Revised Minimal Link Condition.},

The evidence comes from so-pronominalization phenomena in Englsih adjective phrases. I show that in certain pronominalization contexts a dummy adjectival element much is inserted in the functional Q position. This phenomenon of much-support is similar to the phenomenon of do-support in the verbal domain. I further argue that much-insertion is blocked in contexts in which the more economical A-to-Q raising operation can apply.},

Focusing on the internal syntax of Dutch adjective phrases, I will come to the following conclusions. First, there is a strong empirical (and theoretical) basis for extending the functional head hypothesis to the adjectival system (i.e. for adopting the DegP-hypothesis). Secondly, a distinction should be made between two types of funcitonal degree categories: Deg(P) and AP (the split degree system hypothesis). Thirdly, there is empirical support for the existence of a third functional projection, AgrP, within the adjectival domain. Fourthly, as regards directionality of headedness within the Dutch funcitonal system, it is concluded that Deg and Q take their complements to the right, whereas Agr takes its complement to the left. It is proposed that this asymmetry of headedness within the functional structure of the adjectival projection relates to the nominal orientation of Deg and Q and the verbal orientation of Agr. Finally, three movement operations will be identified within the Dutch adjectival system: A-to-Q raising, A-to-Agr raising and leftward scrambling. The latter two are at the basis of the word order variation which is found within the Dutch adjectival system.},

The differences between eventive and stative sentences in the simple present, as well as reportive, futurate and habitual uses of eventive sentences are shown to derive straightforwardly from a single constraint on grammatical tense systems: the Principle of Non-Simultaneity of Points. The analysis supports a view of speech time as a moment, rather than an interval, in the unmarked case, and also supports the purely Davidsonian view that only eventive sentences contain an event-denoting element.},

Subsequent research has revealed that variation within one dialect is quite common. Previous accounts of yes-no question patterns in Southern Min dialects have shown that most have more than one pattern. The present study shows that in some Fujian Southern Min dialects the patterns VP-neg and Adv-VP are mutually exclusive. Data from Xiamen is also presented to show recent innovations in the yes-no question pattern. This innovation is described with a view towards explaining how the origin of the innovative patterns and limitations on their further development are influenced by the distribution of the negatives and modal verbs.},

	Abstract = {In several respects, including binding and quantification, the left-hand conjunct in "left-subordinating" and-constructions (e.g. you drink one more can of beer and I'm leaving) behaves like a subordinate clause. However, treating it as syntactically subordinate results in an unnatural account of its superficially coordinate structure. Thus, the binding and quantification effects must be due to subordination at the level of conceptual structure, not syntactici structure. In addition, certain extraction and inversion phenomena in the left-hand cluase are consistent only with its being coordinated in syntactici structure. A striking consequence is that the Coordinate Structure Constraint holds at conceptual structure, whereas Condition on Extraction Domain effects are strictly syntactic. The left-subordinating and-construction is thus another example of a significant mismatch between syntactic structure and semantic representation.},

The two constructions are associated with different readings for certain sentences. In particular, whereas in certain cases the comitative construction allows only for a collective reading. This difference has been ascribed to a difference in denotation of the two types of phrases. We show that such an analysis is unsatisfactory and propose an alternative anlysis that appeals to pragmatic factors. In particular, we claim that distributive readings are dispreferred in the absence of an overt distributive operator and that pragmatic differences between the types of noun phrases riase the saliency of their subgroups to different degrees, thus making distributive readings more difficult to obtain with comitatives.},

The problem about it can be formulated in the following way: "Where does it come from, since Classical Latin does not possess it, except perhaps with an interfix (BUCC-i-cALLEM), and since it can be reasonably linked neither with previous prepositional phrases (BUCCA DE CALLEM) nor with the Lain genitive construciton (BUCCA CALLIS)?" The answer, obtained by means of the historical comparative linguistics and the reconstruction of Proto-Romance, is that this compound type must have been productive during antiquity in Spoken Latin, as a popular means of coining everyday terms for animals, plants, instruments and place names. It may be that, previous to its Latin origin, it goes back to Indo-European.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we show that a high-ranking syllable contact constraint is the driving force behind the well-known nasalization and lateralization phenomena in Korean. Previous analyses of Korean nasalization and lateralization have accounted for the patterns of altenration by reference to rules of various types and rule ordering, with more recent analyses incorporating feature geometry with underspecificaiton. While some of the previous reserach has indeed noted the importance of syllable contact as a motivating force behind the Korean nasalization and lateralization phenomena, such research has been unable to directly formalize the role that syllable contact plays in Korean phonology. After first presenting the Korean data that highlights the importance of syllabe contact, we develop an optimiality-theoretic analysis of Korean nasalization and laterlization in which SyllCon is an undominated constraint. The high ranking nature of this constraint determines which underlying consonantal sequences undergo altenration. The specific type of alternation (lateralization or nasalization) is determined by the lower ranking constraints. We compare our analysis with previous approaches to the Korean nasalization and lateralization problem found in the literature and argue for the superiority of the optimality-theoretic approach.},

However, Prunet, B{\'e}land, and Idrissi (2000) present Arabic aphasic evidence supporting the lexical (morphemic) status of the consonantal root for Arabic. In this article we offer supporting evidence from Arabic hypocoristics for the morphemic status of the consonantal root.

We show that the empirical arguments which were presented in favor of an extraction analysis are not convincing, and we provide empirical evidence supporting a reanalysis-like approach. Turning to a detailed data discussion, we compare three different kinds of partial constituents: verbal, adjectival, and nominal ones. Adjectival complements pattern with coherently selected verbal complements whereas nominal complements turn out to be less restricted. On the theoretical side, we show that a reanalysis-like theory can be given a formally precise rendering in the HPSG architecture in terms of a lexical argument-raising specification, which is already widely employed in HPSG analyses of coherence in Germanic and restructuring verbs in Romance languages. The account we propose generalizes previous HPSG approaches to partial complements of different categories and correctly predicts the interaction of (partial) VP topicalization with embedded partial NPs or APs.},

The conditions in question have often been discussed in the literature (see especially Riddle 1978). The present article concentrates on the factors that hamper or prevent the use of the present tense. Some of these have to do with the fact that a reporting verb creates an intensional domain, others are related to the speaker's choice of 'temporal focus'. All in all, the factors appear to be numerous and of many different types: they have to do with syntax, semantics, pragmatics, communication structure and context. The theoretical relevance of these findings is that they cast doubt on the traditional 'sequence of tense' analysis of reported speech and corroborate the analysis in terms of 'temporal domains' proposed in Declerck (1991).},

I argue that the essential difference between Verb Raising and Verb Projection Raising constructions is the presence in the latter of a TP in the complement of the matrix verb, a TP whose presence is forced by minimalist locality considerations and whose presence is empirically supported by several properties of VPR constructions, including temporal adverbial modification and cluster-contained subjects in transitive expletive constructions with VPR. The analysis of V(P)R also leads to the conclusion that the Continental West Germanic langauges feature a SCRAMBLING opration distinct from Case-driven NP-movement, a conclusion to which the scope facts of double object Ver (Porjection) Raising constructions lend empirical support.},

While these are familiar from the literature (albeit less than fully understood), our focus will be on a previously unnoted property of wh-the-hell phrases: the fact that their distribution (in single wh-questions) matches that of polarity items (PIs). We lay out the key data supporting this claim, embed the PI nature of wh-the-hell phrases in the theory of polarity developed in Giannakidou 1998, 1999, 2001, and establish the link between the lexical content of these phrases and their PI status by identifying the wh-the-hell as a dependent PI. WE subsequently exploit the PI status of wh-the-hell to explain the more familiar puzzles mentioned above, showing that these are not peculiarities specific to the wh-the-hell but manifestations of the general properties of the class of PIs that wh-the-hell belongs to. The syntactic aspects of the polarity analysis of the wh-the-hell are shown to have important consequences for the fundamental properties of wh-movement in English.},

The optional frunting is shown not to be due to topicalization, focus, or clefting. Optional movement is of theoretical interest because it is not permitted in the Minimalist Program. Derivations are compared and only the most economical succeeds; thus, the optional movement outcome is not expected, and accounting for truly optional movement becomes an interesting question. I solve this problem by allowing optional selection of C from the lexicon. If C and its wh feature appear in the numeration, it will prompt raising of a wh feature and its accompanying wh phrase to check off the wh feature in C. If C does not appear in the numeration, then no wh movement takes place. It is shown how this proposal can account for the position of wh phrases in simple, complex, and embedded quesitons, as well as account for scope facts in Babine-Witsuwit'en. The role of C in other languages -- its selection from the lexicon and the projection of C by certain verbs -- is also briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {The ordering of NPs in Germanic langugaes has received a great deal of attention in the literature on scrambling and object shift. This paper examines the relevant data from Yiddish, and concludes on the basis of a number of tests that the underlying word order in the VP is VO. Among the diagnostic tests used are the semantic constraints placed on shifted objects in Yiddish; that is, they must be definite or specific/generic. It is proposed that this constraint is due to a general interpretation condition which requires the fixing of scope relations in the syntax (relying on the notion of semantically-driven movement developed in Diesing and Jelinek 1995). Examination of the reordering possibilities in Yiddish in comparison with both West Continental Germanic and Scandinavian leads to the conclusion that Yiddish allows scrambling (rather than object shift), placing it in a unique position among the VO Germanic languages. The paper concludes with a discussion of semantically-driven movement in the context of economy conditions such as those proposed by Chomsky (1995).},

	Abstract = {The stem construction in Yiddish is a type of light verb construction in which a light verb (heading an LVP) takes as Asp(ect)P complement, which in turn takes a VP complement (cf. Travis 1992). The AspP is headed by an aspectual operator, yielding a "diminutivized event" interpretation. A puzzling fact about the stem construction is that the verbal elements seem to reflect an OV order, while Yiddish is in other respects a VO language. Thsi OV-like ordering is a consequence of incorporation. A second, more restricted, type of light vrb construction in Yiddish is also discussed, in which the thematic element is an indefinite NP complement. Here there is no AspP; the light verb takes a VP complement which is headed by a null verb which itself takes the predicate nominal as its complement. In both constructions, light verb semantically selects for a complement which denotes some sort of diminutivized event; the differing distribution of the verbal and nominal forms of the light verb construction results from semantic differences betrween the Asp operator and the indefinite determiner.},

The latter analysis is needed for Romanian, because this language does not have nominative SE, as well as for Italian nonfinite clauses, in which nominative SE is illegitimate. According to my restatement of Cinque's (1988) generalizations, [+/- arg] features are not needed. I assume a constrained theory of passivization, according to which the suspended Agent role cannot surface in the syntax as either -en or SE. The passivization of unergatives depends on analyzing unergatives as transitives with null cognate objects.},

	Abstract = {Cross-linguistically, onsetless syllables not only have limited distribution but also exhibit exceptional prosody: in some langauges they are excluded from reduplication, or cannot bear main stress or a high tone. These exceptional properties are clearly linked to the relative ill-formedness of onsetless syllables, but previous analyses do not formalize this correlation in a way that generalizes straightforwardly to all cases of exceptional prosody. I argue in this paper that the theory of Generalized Alignment (McCarthy and Prince 1993a,b), developed within Optimality Theory, provides us with a unified way of accounting for onsetless syllable exceptionality. By constraining the domains for phonological processes to optimally begin with optimal syllables, the exceptional prosody of onsetless syllables can uniformly be analyzed as prosodically motivated constituent misalignment.},

On this view, acquisition proceeds by means of an ordered path, in which cues to parameters become progressively more abstract and grammar-internal. A learner does not attempt to match target forms (contra Gibson and Wexler 1994), but uses them as evidence for parameter setting. Cues are local, and there is no global fitness metric (contra Clark and Roberts 1993). Acquisition of representations and acquisition of grammar proceed together and cannot be decoupled in the manner of Tesar and Smolensky (1998).},

I examine a typical case of cyclicity, namely, stress in Shanghai compounds, where the layers of embedding are in principle unlimited. I show that alignment constraints are inadequate. Instead, identity constraints are needed, in particular Stress-ID which requires that stress locations in the immediate constituents of a compound be the same as when the constituents occur alone. In addition, Stress-ID (and other constraints) must be checked recursively, namely, at every layer of syntactic bracketing. This analysis incorporates the essential properties of the cycle and can therefore handle all cyclic cases. Finally, I discuss the compatibility of recursive constraint evaluation with parallelism, and the remaining differences between a cyclic analysis and recursive constraint evaluation.},

The paper concludes by reconsidering English adjectival and verbal passive constructions, and showing them to be morphologically distinct.},

Polish OCC sentences parallel Romance reduced sentences in exhibiting both monoclausal and biclausal characteristics. To the extent that the OCC and reduced constructions in other languges are a reflex of a singly phenomenon, the Polish data demonstrate that any successful universal analysis should be general enough to allow for simultaneous mono- and biclausal effects. Since Polish and Romance reduced constructions show similar syntactic effects and since analyses which appeal to morphology or place strong emphasis on word order do not extend to the OCC, the Polish data argue that an analysis which is independent of surface expression is more explanatory.},

	Abstract = {In many Romance languges, negative expressions exhibit a robust distributional asymmetry. Whne in post-verbal positions, they require the co-presence of negation; when in pre-verbal positions, they are incompatible with it. In the same languages, bare nominal exhibit a distribution that parallels the negative one in some strking respects. They are possible in post-verbal positions, but infelicitous as pre-verbal subjects. Similar distributional parallelisms between these expressions are shown to obtain cross-linguistically and diachronically and are argued to derive from their common internal syntactic and semantics properties. Both expressions have a 'deficient' DP, lack quantificational force, and are unable to check the D feature of EPP. Bare nominals may lack Do, but negative expressions contain a null Do syntactically licensed under DP internal Spec Head agreement or head movement. As these operations result from parametric options in DP syntax and have consequences on the semantic nature of these expressions, the central result of the paper is to derive cross-linguistic variations in negative concord from independent choices in DP syntax.},

	Abstract = {The present article is an attempt to derive the Affectedness Constraint on the assumption that deliminted predicates project an Aspect node with the feature [+delimieted], in the spirit of Tenny (1987) and Borer (1993). This feature triggers movement of a delimiting argument to the specifier of AspP for checking reasons. Also, it is assumed that a predicate needs a subject and that the specifier of ASp counts as subject of the predicate from which Asp has been projected. If affectedness constructions are distinguished by the fact taht their external argument is missing, having been lexically oppressed, it follows that a derivation converges iff an internal argument can be promoted to subject position; externalization of the internal arguemnt can be promoted to subject position; externalization of the internal argument can be driven only by delimited predicates, because only a delimiting object can be triggered to move to the specifier of Asp [+delimited]. The article concentrates on an affectedness construction in Swedish: have of possession+DP+passive particple. However, it will be argeud that the solution carries over to the other affectedness constructions.},

	Abstract = {This paper argues that donkey pronouns should be construed as definite articles, followed by an NP sister which has undergone deletion in the phonology. So Every man who owns a donkey beats it is claimed to share a Logical Form with Every man who owns a donkey beats the donkey, which means the same. There is independent evidence for assimilating pronouns to determiners, and for NP-deletion; so this theory explains E-type anaphora without postulating any special entity ('E-type pronoun') for the purpose. Since NP-deletion, like other ellipsis, requires an antecedent, this theory also explains the requirement for a "formal link" between donkey pronoun and antecedent, which standard E-type theories find difficult to account for. Other empirical advantages of this thoery include its ability to explain the pattern of strict and sloppy identity displayed by donkey sentences with phonologically reduced continuations. It is shown that Bach-Peters sentences, quantificational subordination, and paycheck sentences can also be dealt with ont eh present account.},

In this part of the Latin verbal system, active forms are synthetic ("verbs") but passive forms are analytic (i.e., participle and finite auxiliary). I show that the two perfects occur in essentially the same structure and are distinguished by a difference in movemetn to T; moreover, the difference in forms can be derived without reference to category labels like "verb" or "adjective" on the Root. In addition, the difference in perfects is determined by a feature with clear syntactic consequences, which must be assoicated arbitrarily with certain Roots, the deponent verbs. I discuss the implications of these points in the context of Distributed Morphology, the theory in which the analysis is framed.},

A primary result is that the locality properties of a Merger operation are determined by the stage in the derivation at which the operation takes place: specifically, Merger that takes place before Vocabulary Insertion, on hierarchical structures, differs from Merger that takes place post-Vocabulary Insertion/ linearization. Specific predictions of the model are tested in numerous case studies. Analyses showing the interaction of syntactic movement, PF movement, and rescue operations are provided as well, including a treatment of English do-support.},

	Abstract = {Drawing on data from Modern Hebrew, I argue that derived argument-taking nominals do not form an aspectually homogeneous class and that the nominal system manifests a perfective/imperfective opposition. Each aspectual type is characterized by a cluster of different syntactic properties. Concretely, it is shown that imperfective nominals, in contrast to perfective nominals, are non-definite, fail to host subjects, and disallow DP internal agreement. The defective nature of imperfective nominals is hypothesized to derive from the absence of the functional head D intheir projection. The difference in the aspectual interpretation of the two types of argument-taking nominals is also attributed to the presence or absence of D. Teh proposed account of aspect in the nominal system provides a prinicipled explanation for the mass properties of argument-taking nominals, linking the latter to the aspectual non-delimitedness of these nominals.},

I argue that the Copy Theory of movement allows the prediction of ambiguity in Someone must have left and Every doesn't like squid; English subjects in Spec, IP optionally delete at LF, allowing their VP-internal copies to adjoin below mustn't (giving the subject's narrow scope reading). But subjects with governed CAse cannot delete, so the Chinese equivalents are unambiguous. The same distinction underlies the Chinese/English difference for (e.g.) Everyone recommended abook. English subjects, with agreement Case, allow objects to raise over them at LF; but Chinese subjects, with governed Case, block objects from raising, preventing ambiguity. Evidence for this account comes from correct predictions about amiguity in sentences with double objects or PPs; correlations with ECP phenomena; and the fact that Japanese, Korean, and Persian behave (largely) like Chinese.},

Scrambling as movement is incompatible with central assumptions of the Minimalist Program: it cannot involve the checkign of strong categorial features. Concentrating on German, the article refutes the standard empirical arguments for scrambling and shows that free constituent order is a base-generated phenomenon. The article proposes that theta-role assignment is a by-product of checking the formal features of arguments. When checking features are strong, word order is fixed; when checking features are weak, free constituent order arises owing to a relativized interpretation of the Minimal Link Condition.},

It is shown that the entire cluster of syntactic and semantic properties that characterize direct perception constructions follows from the proposed analysis, in conjunction with independently motivated principles of grammar.},

@article{Feng:1996,
	Abstract = {In diachronic studies of Chinese syntax, an interesting question is why the two SOV structures, [wh-object V] and [Neg Pro-object V] in Early Archaic Chinese (EAC, 1000-5000 BC) disappeared after the Han Dynasty (206 BC). This paper proposes that these two notable OV orders in EAC are structurally distinct and that the structure of [wh V] is also different fromthat of [wh Neg/Aux V]. Furthermore, it is argued that Proto-Chinese is an SOV language and that the change from SOV (Proto-Chinese) to SVO (EAC) caused a stress shift from preverbal to postverbal position. According to the theory developed here, some problems that have remained in the syntax of Classical Chinese cease to exist, including the following: Why did the two OV structures remain in EAC? Why did the [wh-object V] order disappear later than the [Neg Pro-object V] order? Why did monosyllabic wh-words (e.g., he 'what') but not disyllabic wh-expressions (e.g., he-shi 'what thing') immediately precede the verb? And why was the disappearance of the [wh-object V] structure followed by a development of disyllabic wh-words (e.g., he wu 'what thing' > hewu 'what')? Each of these questions is answered in terms of prosody. The arguments made here claim that prosody is very important in resolving questions of how changes take place.},

I propose a Shortest Move requirement that essentially disallows movement across a relevant intervening checker (as opposed to a relevant intervening position), thereby eliminating equidistance stipulations and relativization (Rizzi 1990) of movement types (i.e. the [non-natural] class: A, A', Xo). As a result, I obtain a unified account of object shift and incorporation, while partially deducing Holmberg's (1986) Generalization.

	Abstract = {This paper deals with wh-questions in Selayarese, discussing two superficially similar constructions that display different properties along the path between the wh-operatr and the gap. The constructions behave differently with respect to weak crossover, the occurrence of overt complementizers and agreement affixes, and word order. I argue that these difference follow from the hypothesis that the gap in one wh-construction is formed by cyclic movement while the other construction involves simple binding between an A' (non-argument) position and a null resumptive element in an A (argument) position. The resumptive A' dependency, however, also displays some surprising movement diagnostics, and so I argue that a wh-operator enters derivation in A' position, binds the A position, and then undergoes movement to its overt position. The analysis also involves the postulation of a Specifier position below C' where focus features are checked. Arguments are presented tha tthis position is an A' position, and that it creates an island for other cyclic movement. In addition, the extraction patterns highlight the role of agreement features on functional heads, in particular C, and the different ways in which they may be checked.},

I expose some important formal differences among these alternatives and examine five phenomena, some previously unnoted, that distinguish them empirically. No single approach succeeds in capturing all of the facts that should arguably follow from a theory of locality, but the bulk of the evidence seems to support a theory that defines locality using only simple and independently motivated syntactic objects and relations.},

The Trigger Learning Algorithm of Gibson and Wexler (1994) is a guessing system. Gibson and Wexler show that under some reasonable assumptions it may never attain the target grammar. I propose instead a deterministic device that waits for unambiguous triggers to set parameters. This learner must be able to detect parametric ambiguity. This is not possible on the classical conception of triggers as sentences that flip parameter switches. It is possible if a trigger (and the parameter value it triggers is a piece of tree structure, perhaps a single feature, made available by Universal Grammar, and adopted into the learner's grammar if input sentences cannot be parsed without it.},

It presents new evidence that Condition C applies at (and only at) LF and demonstrates that this condition can serve as a powerful tool for distinguishing among various claims regarding the nature of LF and the inventory of semantic mechanisms. The conclusions reached are these (1) Scope reconstruction is represented in the syntax (semantic type-shifting operations are very limited). (2) A'-chains have the following properties: (a) Scope reconstruction results from deleting the head of the chain and interpreting the head of the chain with a copy of the restrictor at the tail (unless this option is impossible, as in antecedent-contained deletion, in which case the copy is changed to a variable as in standard notations). (c) VP adjunction is an intermediate landing site. (3) A-chains are different in a way that at the moment requires a stipulative distinction.},

	Abstract = {In the recent literature, a number of phonological papers have addressed the question of the relation between Focus and prosodic domains and how Focus determines phonological phrasing (Selkirk 1986, 1993, Kanerva 1990, Kenesei and Vogel 1990, Zec and Inkelas 1990). This paper deals specifically with the prosodic domain of Focus in Italian. Building on the theory of Prosodic Phonology, as presented by Selkirk (1984), Nespor and Vogel (1986), this paper provides evidence for the influence of Focus in the applicaiton of phonological rules in Italian and proposes a theory for deriving prosodic constituency in broad as well as narrow Focus sentences.
On the basis of the examined data, the problem of main prominence assignment is also dealt with, proposing a "prosodically revised" version of Cinque's (1993) Null Theory.
Finally, prosodic data is examined for the syntactici information that it triggers (syntaictic structure is hte input for prosodic mapping rules). Thus, the inclusion of Focus in the feature-checking mechanism will be proposed. Focus information is encoded in a strong feature, which causes the derivaiton to have specific properties prior to the interface level. The paper concludes by showign that the computational system seems to operate homogeneously with all kinds of Focus constructions, providing a spell out structure which, after prosodic mapping, allows Focus to be interpreted at <PF,LF>.},

This view contrasts with analyses of process nominals as (pure) nominals with partial verbal properties, originally due to Chomsky (1970). Contributing to this debate, we will argue that direct evidence indicates that English process nominals contain a VP. Our evidence comes from the ditribution of adverbs on the one hand, and from the presence of the VP anaphor do so in process nominals on the other. We show that a portion of the verbal extended projection specifically excluding IP or CP is present in process nominals. An array of word order facts about process nominals falls into place when we further assume that hte verb is raised from VP over the subject, the object, and adverbs, adjoing to a nominal affix. Our analysis moreover adds to the evidence for functional structure above VP and supports particular claims about the syntax-morphology interface.},

@article{Fukui:1998,
	Abstract = {This article proposes a theory of phrase structure which is free from unmotivated stipulations as much as possible and which is also compatible with the most restrcitive theory of parametric variation currently available (cf. Fukui (1995)), with a special focus on the nature and role of linear order and functional categories. A hypothesis called the "Symmetry of Derivation" is put forth, according to which the computations in the overt syntax (i.e., the pre-Spell-Out computations) and the computations in the (pre-Morphology) phonological component are "symmetric" in the sense that they form mirror images of each other. More specifically, we propose that language computation maps an array of linguistic elements to an interface representation in such a way that it starts with a lexical item (a head) proceeding in a bottom-up fashion (Merge) and at some point of this step-by-step derivational process (Spell-Out) starts "decomposing" the structures already formed in a top-down fashion ("Demerge") until the derivation reaches a completely unstructured sequence with a fixed linear order.
It is shown that this symmetry principle explains the major properties of phrsae structure in an elegant way. The principle accounts for the apparently universal "leftness" property of Spec in a straightforward way by attributing its leftness to the top-down computation Demerge encounters. With respect to the order between head and its complement, wich allows for cross-linguistic variation (head-initial vs. head-last), the symmetry principle predicts that the head-last order is derived by movement, in clear contrast with Kayne's (1994) approach. The difference between head-initial English adn head-last Japanese is, then, attributed to different propoerties of "light verb" v (Chomsky (1995b)): v has the property of attracting V in English but not in Japanese. Numerous theoretical and empirical consequences are shown to follow in an interesting way from this hypothesis, coupled with the symmetry principle of derivations.},

It is argued that heretofore unnoticed distributional properties of adverbs point to the conclusion that the finite verb does not leave the extended verbal projection (i.e., vP/VP) in embedded clauses of Old English. Therefore, we claim that in these contexts, variation in the placement of the finite verb has to be attributed to competing grammars that differ with respect to parameter settings associated with the functional head v (contra the Double Bse Hypothesis, Pintzuk 1999). Moreover, the proposed analysis provides a principled account for the intriguing fact that a certain serialisation pattern (S-V-O-Vfin) is absent from the variety of ordering possibilities encountered in Old English. It is further argued that our account opens up a new perspective on a set of syntactic factors whcih can be shown to have a statistically significant influence on the position of the finite verb in embedded clauses.},

	Abstract = {Past theoretical analyses have claimed that some languages employ a special type of phonological spreading of a consonantal over a vowel, long-distance consonantal spreading. I argue that this type of spreading can and must be eliminated from the theory, by reducing it to segmental copying as in reduplication. This elimination is first motivated from a number of perspectives, including considerations of locality and theoretical redundancy. The reduction to reduplication is then developed in detail for Temiar, one of the main indigenous languages of Malayasia, notorious for the complexity of its copying patterns. Crucial to this reduction is the notion of gradient violation of constraints in Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993), and the notion of correspondence, with its particular application to reduplication (McCarthy and Prince 1995a). The proposal extends to other languages (e.g. Arabic, Chaha, Modern Hebrew, and Yoruba), where the putative spreading had been thought necessary. The elimination of long-distance consonantal spreading is aruged to further obviate two other special mechanisms, also thought to apply ona language-particular basis: (a) the representation that segregates vowels and consonants on different planes, known as V/C planar segregation, and (b) the distinct mode of word formation consisting of mapping segments to templates},

Rather these processes reflect an independent prosodic structure, which includes prosodic categories such as metrical foot, prosodic word, and phonological phrase. Five experiments examined English-speaking two-year-olds' omissions of object ariticles in different prosodic structures. The data indicate that children omit unfooted syllables and that foot boundaries, in turn, are influenced by prosodic word and phonological phrase boundaries. Thus, it appears that children create prosodic stuctures remarkably similar to those proposed in theories of prosodic phonology.},

	Abstract = {With the advent of functional as well as lexical structure within the noun phrase, there exists much syntactic structure that appears to be unused. While there has been discussion as to which inflectional categories project structure, the question of whether lexical categories project has not been raised. In this paper it is claimed that common nouns in Persian do not project to maximal categories, i.e. do not appear with a complement and a specifier position. Several facts follow as a consequence. First, we explain an intriguing property of Ezafe construcution in Modern Persian, namely that all modifiers of nouns must be heads themselves. We also have an explanation for the presence of the Ezafe vowel itself, which is analyzed as a linker affixed to Xos at PF to identify elements forming a nominal constituent. Finally, we explain why only one possessor is possible within Persian noun phrases. Since nouns cannot project complement and specifier positions, the only position available for a possessor is [SPEC, DP].},

In this paper I propose an anlysis of affective contexts as nonveridical and treat negative polarity as a manifestation of the more general phenomenon of sensitivity to (non)veridicality (which is, I argue, what affective dependencies boil down to). Empirical support for this analysis will be provided by a detailed examination of affective dependencies in Greek, but the distribution of any will also be shown to follow from (non)veridicality.},

	Abstract = {The main claim of this paper is that a general theory of negative concord (NC) should allow for the possibility of NC involving scoping of a universal quantifier above negation. I propose that Greek NC instantiates this option. Greek n-words will be analyzed as polarity sensitive universal quantifiers whcih need negation in order to be licensed, but must raise above negation in order to yield the scoping Anot. This gives the correct interpretation of NC structures as general negative statements. The effect is achieved by application of QR, and the account is fully compositional, as only sentence negation is the vehicle of logical negation. Greek n-words are also compared to n-words in Romance, Slavic, and Hungarian. This analysis, if correct, has two important consequences. First, the analysis will provide a strong argument for retaining QR in the syntax-semantics mapping: we neet it in order to interpret NC. Second, by employing a mechanism which is present in the grammar for the scope of quantifiers anyway, we have a simpler theory which makes NC look less anomalous; appeal to a mechanism invoked just to account for NC, as in the "negative absorption" tradition, is thus rendered unnecessary.},

Marked types of morphology (infixes, circumfixes, zero affixes; subtractive, reduplicative and templatic morphology) are represented in exactly the same way as roots.

The analysis uses purely phonological constraints without recourse to language-specific or meter-specific constraints and without an abstract metrical template (Helsloot 1997). I show that the number of tokens per metrical type correlates with phonological well-formedness in one of five areas: binarity, weight, alignment, identity, and thythm. In addition, I showt hat poems written in this meter have no perfectly metrical lines in them: every line violates some constraint because absolute metrical well-formedness is not possible given the constraints in this type of meter. Gradient well-formedness in meter (Youmans 1989) is shown to be both demonstrable and formalizable.},

By the test of obedience to Subjacency, sto and koji relaitves are formed by successive cyclic movement, where za koga relatives are formed by pronominal linkage. Eliticited production and comprehension experiments were conducted with preschool children. We interpret the results as evidence that children initially treat sto relaives as nonmovement relatives, contrary to the facts of the adult grammar. Za koga relatives are mastered by only a small number of children. We discuss our results in the context of the cross-linguistic typology of relative clauses and previous studies of the acquisition of relative clauses, arguing that a nonmovement analysis of relatives is unmarked for relative clause formation (in comparison to wh-question formation) and that a nonmovement analysis may represent a common first stage in the acquisition of relative clauses.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines aspectual be-type constructions in African American English. These constructions receive a habitual interpretation, but they are distinguished from simple tense generics in that they are not ambiguous between generic/habitual and capacity readings. The analysis proposed to account for these constructions is one in which aspectual be neutralizes the distinction between stage- and individual-level predicates. Following Kratzer (1995), I assume that stage-level predicates have a separate event argument associated with them, but individual-level predicates do not. Aspectual be forces individual-level predicates to take an eventuality argument which coerces them into stage-level predicates. Teh logical representations of these constructions are given a tripartite structure in which a habitual operator binds variables ranging over eventualities.
The analysis can be extended to account for constructions in which permanently stable entities indicated by bare plural subjects occur with be-type predicates. The solution proposed here accounts for some well-known properties of aspectual be that have not been discussed in the literature.},

The formation of wh clusters is motivated by the assumption that wh elements can act as landing sites for wh movement due to the morphological properties of wh words. I further argue that langauges such as Japanese constitute covert instances of this process of wh cluster formation, accounting for intricate constraints on multiple wh questions such as the so-called "additional-wh effect." Another central claim of the article is that despite appearances, multiple wh questions in German equally involve the formation of wh clusters, which are shown to consist of one visible and one or more invisible wh elements. This analysis provides a new account for the lack of "short" and the rpesence of "long" superiority effects in German.},

@article{Grewendorf:1999,
	Abstract = {This paper argues that short (clause-internal) scrambling to a pre-subject position has A-properties in Japanese but A'-properties in German, while long scrambling (scrambling across sentence boundaries) form finite clauses, which is possible in Japanese but not in German, has A'-properties throughout. It is shown that these differences between German and Japanese can be traced back to parametric variation of phrase structure and the parameterized properties of functional heads. Due to the properties of Agreement, sentences in Japaense may contain multiple (Agro- and Agrs-) specifiers whereas German does not allow for this. In Japanese, a scrambled element may be located in a Spec AgrP, i.e., an A- or L-related position, whereas scrambled NPs in German can only appear in an AgrP-adjoined (broadly-L-related) position, which only has A'-properties. Given our assumption that successive cyclic adjunction is generally impossible, elements in German may not be long scrambled because a scrambled element that is moved to an adjunction site inside an embedded clause may not move further. In Japanese, long distance scrambling out of finite CPs is possible since scrambling may proceed in a successive cyclic manner via embedded Spec-(AgrP) positions. Our analysis of the differences between German and Japanese scrambling provides us with an account of further contrasts between the two langauge such as the existence of surprising asymmetries between German and Japanese remnant-movement phenomena, and the fact that , unlike German, Japanese freely allows wh-scrambling. Investigation of the properties of Japaense wh-movement also leads us to the formulation of the wh-cluster Hypothesis, which implies that Japanese is an LF multiple wh-fronting language.},

@incollection{Groat:1996,
	Abstract = {In Chomsky's (1993) "A Minimalist Program for Linguistic Theory" (MPLT), syntactic derivations yield two generally distinct ouput phrase-markers that re relevant to the linguistic system: the LF phrsae-marker, which receives semantic interpretation, and a phrase-marker which is Spelled-out to the phonological/morphological systems. Furthermore, the rule SPELL-OUT may be applied freely, i.e. at any point in the derivation of an LF phrase-marker, subject to well-formedness conditions indirectly imposed on the phrase-marker by PF-interface conditions (for example, the obligatory non-appearance of uninterpretable strong features) and principles of economy (for example, the global economy principle Procrastinate). However, the system thus formulated introduces small but significant asymmetries into the syntactic computational system: pre-Spell-out operations are stipulated to be more costly than those occurring after Spell-out, strict cyclicity is enforced only before Spell-out, and the lexicon is inaccessible after Spell-out.
Our paper attempts to eliminate these asymmetries by postulating that Spell-out does not occur freely, but rather must always be applied to the same phrase-marker that receives LF-interpretation, i.e. there are no post-Spell-out syntactic operations. The potential for pre-/post-Spell-out asymmetries is eliminated, resulting in a uniform computational system without stipulated (and hence undesirable) asymmetries. We provide further support for our model on a conceptual basis, through an analysis of the strict cycle condition in which we derive the Extension Condition for substitution operations from principles of X-bar theory, giving the strong result that there could be no countercyclic substitution at all, even after Spell-out -- a result that is not problematic if there are no syntactic operations after Spell-out.
In our system, the difference betweeen overt and covert movement is found on the level of chain-formation: overt movement is movement which carries phonological features to the head of the chain being created, while covert movement leaves phonological material behind. This approach allows us to construe the Procrastinate principle as a purely local economy constraint. Analyses of subjacency effects in Japanese null operator movement (Watanabe 1992) and Icelandic Object Shift provide empirical support for the analysis.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that there are more kinds of relative clause constructions between the linguistic heaven and earth than are dreamed of in the classical lore, which distinguishes just restrictive relative clauses and appositives. We start with degree relatives. Degree, or amount, relatives show restrictions in the relativizers they allow, in the determiners that can combine with them, and in their stacking possibilities. To account for these facts, we propose an analysis with two central, and novel, features: First, we argue that the standard notion of degree (a number on a measuring scale) needs to be replaced by a notion of structured degree, which keeps track of the object measured. Second, we argue that at the CP-level of degree relatives an operation of (degree) maximalization takes place. We show that the observed facts concerning degree relatives follow from these assumptions. We then broaden the discussion to other relative clause constructions. We propose that the operation of maximalization takes place in relative clauses when the head noun is semantically interpreted CP-internally, while syntactically the CP is part of a DP that also contains CP-external material. Based on this, we argue that degree relatives form part of a linguistically coherent class of relative clause constructions -- we call them maximalizing relatives -- which all show restrictions similar to those observed for degree relatives, and which differ semantically (and often also syntactically) both from restrictive relative clauses and from appositives. We discuss free relatives, internally-headed relatives, and correlatives.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we discuss the structure of a kind of Catalan compounds that seem to contradict Lieber's proposal that there is a single parameter fixing the position of hte head with respect to complements, modifiers and specifiers for both syntax ad morphology. Catalan has a kind of compound formed by a verbal root, the head, preceded by an inalienable possession noun (IPN). These compounds pose two problems. The first one has to do with the order of elements in the compounds: They seem to hold an OV order instead of the regular VO order of Catalan. The second problem is related to the semantic interpretation of hte construciton: the Theme of a verbal phrase headed by these compounds is also interpreted as the possessor of the IPN within the compound. We claim, first, that the IPN is not complement of the verbal root but a modifier. Second, we claim that Catalan modifiers are always generated in a pre-head position, both in morphology and in syntax. In syntactici structures they appear after the head because the head raises to check its features. In morphology, on the other hand, the movement does not exist, so the modifier remains to the left of the head. Finally, the double interpretation of the object is a consequence of a process of lexical subordination of the IPN's Lexical Conceptual Structure to the Lexcial Conceptual STructure of the verbal root in the lexical process of composition.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a construction from (spoken) German that will be called INTEGRATED VERB SECOND (IV2). This term refers to V2 clauses that look like relative clauses except that they must contain a weak demonstrative in initial position and have to be extraposed. Their syntactic behavior will be accounted for by a paratactic analysis. IV2 can only modify wide scope indefinites inside what looks like hte matrix clause. This is captured at the level of DRS construction. Since the matrix clause alone doesn't constitute a complete informational unit, IV2 can be introduced as a condition into the matrix DRS before evaluation. The weak demonstrative of IV2 establishes the relative link by copying a top-level discourse marker. In addition, the assertional nature of IV2 prevents it from modifying definite descriptions. Reference is made to the close relatedness of demonstrative and relative pronoun sin Indo-European. Dutch, Swedish, and Zurich German provide the comparative horizon of this study. My answer to the question int he title is negative from the syntactic perspective but positive with reference to interpretation.},

It is argued that there is no evidence for the claim in the literature that conditions on extraction license structural embedding of CP-recursion in this langauge. It is shown that ECV2s in Frisian have generally the properties of root CPs and that there is no reason to analyze such constructions differenlty from structural roots. As a consequence, the approach defended here treats ECV2s and their matrix cluases as a combination of indpeendent expressions, i.e., as expressions having their own illocutionary role. This accounts for restrictions on the distribution of embedded V2. Finally, it is demonstrated along the lines of Hoeksema nd Napoli (1993) that ECV2s in Frisian are juxtaposed with their matrix cluases, i.e. they should be distinguished as cases of parataxis from 'normal' coordination.},

The distribution of the auxiliary in the Infinitivus pro Participio (IPP) construction provides evidence for three functional heads in the lower middle field: Neg, T, and F2. The word order in the IPP construction is derived by head movement of the auxiliary and XP-movement of the IPP complement. The IPP complement moves to [Spec, FP2] to check its formal features; the finite auxiliary moves either to F2 or to the higher functional head, T or Neg; the nonfinite auxiliary remains in F2. The anlysis accounts for the finite/nonfinite asymmetry in the distribution of the negative affix en. The article includes concrete proposals for the implementation of feature checking.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of the finite verb in the West Flemish Infinitivus Pro Participio construction provides evidence for embedded V-movement in the lower Middle Field of the West Germanic SOV languages. Two functional heads are postulated in the lower Middle Field, F1 (whcih checks Tense and Negation) and F2 (which checks aspect). FP1 dominates FP2. Finite verbs may remain in F2, or move to F1 (depending on feature strength), infinitives remain in F2. The analysis accounts for the finite/non-finite asymmetry in the distribution of the negative head en in West Flemish and provides indirect support for Kayne's antisymmetry hypothesis. West Flemish bare infinitival complements remain tot he right of F2, IPP complements occupy the specifier position of FP2, and past participle sincorporate to F1. A parallelism between DP positions adn the positions of non-finite verbal complements is explored in the final part of the paper.},

The paper compares antisymmetric approaches which assume short or no V-movement and antisymmetric approaches which postulate double movement: V-to-I movement + remnant movement. The data discussed concern (i) the position of the verb, (ii) the observed correlation of V-movement with certain patterns of argument distribution (object shift, the transitive expletive construction), and (iii) the expression of sentential negation. The data suggest that a double movement analysis is preferable to accounts without V-to-I movement.},

	Abstract = {The serialization patterns of result predicates correlate in a specific manner with headedness: in VO languages, result predicates are found potentially in two different positions, a V-adjacent one and a position at the end of VP. In OV languages, the position of result predicates is invariably V-adjacent. The serialization of depictive predicates with respect to result predicates is a funciton of both a contiguity requirement between the depictive predicate and its target, and the identification parameter for argument positions. The implications of the analysis of the factors that deterine the serialization of predicates provide crucial evidence for a theoretical issue. It is argued that the headedness (head-initial vs. head-final) is best accounted for in terms of head chains rather than in terms of evacuated head initial projections.},

In numerous cases it forms a lexical constituent with a preverb, occurring at the leftmost edge of the surface verb word, much in the manner of Dutch and German verb-particle arrangements in verb-second finite clauses. In Navajo the initial and final positions are separated by eith morpheme order "slots" recognized in the Athabaskan literature (and described in detail for Navajo in Young and Morgan 1987). A phonological solution to this and a number of other deep-surface disparities is explored here, based on teh insights of earlier works on the Navajo verb, including Speas 1984, 1990, McDonough 1996, 2000, and Rice 1989, 2000.},

	Abstract = {Current research on diachronic syntax has yet to provide an account of syntactic change consistent with our theoretical understanding of "knowledge of language" and its acquisition. However, explanatory adequacy requires us to account for all acquisition -- this includes the acquisition of grammars that diverge from their sources (i.e., change) as well as that of fully convergent grammars. This paper argues that an adequate explanation of change phenomena is unattainable given the current widespread confusion regarding such critical conepts as "language," "language change," and "syntax." It seeks to develop a coherent theory of syntactic change, which necessitates clarification of these fundamental matters. I believe that syntactic change should fall out from an adequate theory of syntax (along with a learning algorithm). This paper frames these issues within a Minimalist perspective. Finally, I present evidence that the study of change may provide valuable insights into the proper characterizaton of certain syntactic phenomena within current syntactic theory.},

Drawing on the generative literature in phonological acquisition, as well as the work of phoneticians and psycholinguists, we offer alternative parsing algorithms and examine their implications for learnability and the initial ranking of Optimality Theory constraints. Finally, we propose that the resolution of the comprehension/production dilemma lies not in the phonological domain (linguistic competence), but in the domain of the implementation of linguistic knowledge (performance).},

It is proposed that the IE accentual system was much like that of modern Russian or Lithuanian in that the accent was a distinctive property of morphemes, and words without accent received initial stress. A set of simple rules is developed to account for this stress distribution. Since the theory predicts that loss of lexical accent should result in initial stress, the initial stress found, for example in Celtic, Germanic, and Italic, is attributed to this loss. A series of natural steps is outlined to account for the further evolution of a system with initial stress into one with noninitial stress of the kind found in Latin or Attic Greek.},

@article{Ham:1998,
	Abstract = {This paper presents an Optimality Theoretic (Prince adn Smolensky 1993; McCarthy and Prince 1995) analysis of diachronic phonological change as the reranking of violable constraints, taking the emergence of word-medial geminates in West Germanic as a case study. West Germanic is characterized by, among other things, the gemination of all consonants -- except *r -- after a short vowel and before *j (Gmc *skapjan > OS skeppian, OE scieppan vs. Got skapjan, ON skepjai'to create') and the gemination of voiceless stops before *r and *l (*akr- > OHG akkar, OS akkar vs. Got. akrs, ON akr 'field'). Evidence from versification and word division in original documents suggests that all Germanic dialects favored bimoraic stressed syllables, syllabifying *skapjan as *skap.jan, for example. Thsi often resulted in faulty syllable contacts in which the coda consonant was less sonorous than the following onset. Murray and Vennemann (1983) propose that genimates arose in order to repair such faulty syllable contacts (e.g., *skap.jan > *skap.pjan), but their analysis fails to satisfactorily account for the full scope of the West Germanic Gemination. I propose here that while gemination before *r and *l was driven by favorable sonority differences at syllable margins, the more pervasive appearance of geminates before *j simply resulted from a well-attested Germanic dispreference for *j in onset-initial position.},

	Abstract = {Acquisition research has shown that, in German, the use of nulll subjects does not drop from about 50% to %5 in a very short space of time, but there is a drop from about 45% to between 10% and 20%. In the present article, I investigate this 10% to 20% Null Subject stage in 3-year-olds and show that this stage, though surprisingly long, is not final. Moreover, the children under investigation use structures in this phase that are found neither in the state of Early Null Subjects nor in adult German, namely postverbal referential null subjects. The latter result, the fact that this stage is not final, and the differences to object-drop at the same time strongly suggest that the phenomenon cannot only be topic-drop. An analysis is proposed admitting competing strategies for a certain tiem, a topic-drop strategy (i.e., a strategy of identification via discourse), and a strategy of licensing and identifying null subjects through feature transfer under Government.},

	Abstract = {Many analyses of reduplication within Optimality Theory have relied upon the use of a prosodic template constraint to determine the surface shape of a reduplicant. Semai, a language spoken in Malaysian, presents an interesting challenge for such an analysis. The surface form of the reduplicant in the phenomenon presented here is a string of two consonants. This type of reduplicaiton fits in with the classification of bare-consonant reduplication, where a surface reduplicant is either a single consonant or a string of two consonants. In this paper, I discuss the difficulties in applying a prosodic template analysis to this data, and I propose an alternative account. This alternative account is formulated under the Compression Model, a model in which the shape of a reduplicant is determined by the satisfaction of morphological alignment constraints, not by the use of a prosodic template.},

In particular, it claims that focus within weak NPs, but not within strong NPs, affects the logical form of the sentence, giving rise to 'f(ocus)-a(affected)' readings. In a f-a reading, the nonfocused part of the sentence functions as the restriction of the determiner and the focused predicate functions as the matrix. The existence of f-a readigns is shown to provide an argment for treating weak NPs that exhibit the Definiteness Effect as quantificaitonal, instead of analyzing their determiners as cardinality predicates.},

I try to show that on empirical grounds the proposed account compares favorably with other analyses that shy away from ambiguity. I furthermore suggest that the ambiguity is not implausible conceptually because it can be viewed as reflecting an intermediate stage of the Jespersen Cycle. Negative Concord can be observed in many languages. the data discussed here are taken from Romance, primarily Spanish.},

This treatment yields an integrated account of the syntactic and semanticopragmatic properties of the construction, but leads to the conclusion that certain syntactic constraints apply to a level of representation more abstract than LF under most current conceptions. This representation is built up in the proces of discourse interpretation and may constitute the interface with the conceptual-intentional system of mind.},

The theory accounts for most of the properties of SF: why it applies only when there is a subject gap; why it affects almost any cateogry, head or phrase; the locality conditions; and the crosslinguistic variation. SF belongs to Narrow Syntax, not the phonological component. Althought the features moved by SF are invisible at LF, the specifier position created by SF is visible and is used by other categories that are visible at LF but invisible at PF.},

	Abstract = {The paper deals with variation found among the Scandinavian languages and English concerning word order and agreement in passives. The variation concerns, among other things, whether the language does or does not have (a) participle agreement, (b) the order expletive-aux-NP-participle, (c) an expletive passive double object construction, (d) the \emph{wh}-expletive-participle, and (e) so-called complex passives. This is argued to be the result of variation along a set of parameters, including whether the expletive has phi-features, whether the particple head has phi-features, and whether it also has an EPP-feature. The framework is that of Chomsky (2001), assuming Agree, hence not assuming obligatory spec-head agreement with covert movement to check phi-features or Case. Certain apparent cases of obligatory spec-headagreement in Swedish and Norwegian are discussed and explained as the result of an economy condition. A modification is proposed concerning the phase impenetrability condition.},

This article argues that obligatory control structures are also formed by movement. Minimalism makes this approach viable by removing D-Structure as a grammatical level. Implementing the suggestion, however, requires eliminating the last vestiges of D-Structure still extant in Chomsky's (1995) version of the Minimalist Program. In particular, it requires dispensing with the Theta-Criterion adn adopting the view that theta-roles are featurelike in being able to license movement.},

@article{Horvath:1997,
	Abstract = {This paper explores the cross-linguistics status of the so-called Wh-scope-marker strategy of wide scope assignment through the study of its instantiation in Hungarian, assessing the role and distribution of the expletive-like Wh-element (what). After establishing the existence of the construction in Hungarian via novel types of arguments, a variety of evidence is presented showing the inadequacy of the leading analysis of Wh-expletive constructions with overt partial Wh-movement: proposals based on the formation of a Wh-chain linking the scope-marking Wh-expletive in the higher Spec with the partially moved contentful Wh-phrase, in a way that mimics overt full Wh-movement chains (originating in McDaniel's (1989) work on German and Romani, assumed subsequently, with some modifications, e.g. by Rizzi (1992), Brody (1993), McDaniel, Chiu and Maxfield (1995) and M{\''u}ller (1995)). I motivate an alternative account, falling within the general framework of an indirect Wh-dependency approach proposed by Dayal (e.g. 1994, based on the in-situ Wh of Hindi). I argue that the scope-marker of Hungarian is not an A-bar expletive, but an expletive element generated in an A-position which has a CP as its associate, and which undergoes (overt) movement to an A-bar position due to being a Wh-morpheme. The construction is shown to arise as a by-product of independently motivated processes: (a) Wh-feature percolation from Spec, as in (clausal) pied-piping cases, and (b) an expletive-CP association, argued to be due to needs inherent to clausal complementation in the language and independent of any Wh-feature or scope-assignment. In spite of the shared indirect Wh-dependency concept and the assumption of CP being the 'associate', Dayal's particular analysis (1994) is shown to be empirically distinct from mine, and to be untenable for Hungarian, as well as for German. An initial three-way comparison of Hungarian vs. Hindi vs. German suggests that (at least) the syntactic implementation of the Wh-expletive strategy is different in each of the three languages. So contrary to tearlier conceptions, this phenomenon does not arise from some unitary parametric source, such as the availability of a Wh-expletive morpheme; rather it seems to be parasitic on independent syntactic properties exhibited by the individual languages.},

Because Optimality Theory (OT; e.g., Prince and Smolensky 1993) is built on surface output conditions (and in more recent versions constraints comparing input and output representations and enforcing uniformity in paradgims), any such cases of intermediate representations raise nontrivial questions for OT. These cases become more interesting and revealing when we try to provide comprehensive OT accounts using the general devices employed in the OT literature. This article examines Tiberian Hebrew spirantization in greater detail and demonstrates that spirantization and related phenomena cannot be adequately handled nonderivationally in OT.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between a motion sentence (e.g., Amy went from Denver to Indianapolis.) and an extent sentence (e.g., The road goes from Denver to Indianapolis.), building upon Jackendoff's (1983) analysis. It is shown that the semantic functions for motion and extent senses, respectively GO and GOext, are distinct, but that they share a great deal of internal structure. While both functions express successive transition from one component state to the next, they differ in (a) the presence vs. absence of the passage of time, and (b) the identity of the mover through transition.
The analysis presented here based on semantic functions comes closer to an overall characterization of the motion/extent contrast than the image-schema-based approach (Lakoff 1987) or the metaphor-based approach (Lakoff \& Turner 1989). It can also be easily extended to account for types of extent sentences that the literature has not focussed upon.},

In particular, the NP the whole afternoon behaves syntacticially like a direct object, even though it is clearly not licensed by the verb sleep. This construction is shown to be distinct from two others that it superficially resembles, the resultative and the way-construction. It is also compared with a number of other semi-idiomatic VP constructions. Two approaches for licensing the NP object are compared: a lexical rule approach, in which sleep away is treated as a complex verb that licenses the object, and a constructional approach, in which V NP away is listed as a meaning-bearing construction that licenses both the verb and the object.},

@article{Jacobson:2000,
	Abstract = {This paper argues for the hypothesis of direct compositionality (as in, e.g. Montague 1974), according to which the combinatory syntactic rules specify a set of well-formed expressions while the semantic combinatory rules work in tandem to directly supply a model-theoretic interpretation to each expression as it is "built" in teh syntax. (This thus obviates the need for any level like LF and, concomitatnly, for any rules mapping surface structures to such a level.) I focus here on one related group of phenomena: the interaction of "paycheck" pronouns iwth Weak Crossover effects and i-within-i effects. These interactions were studied in Jacobson (1977) as they show up in Bach-Peters sentences. There I argued that these interactions show that paycheck pronouns have a complex representation at LF; here I show that all of the observations in this earlier work are compatible with the hypothesis of direct compositionality. The key tool is the adoption of a variation-free semantics (a semantics which makes no use of variables as part of the semantic machinery). IN addition to the gneeral consequences for the syntax/semantics interface, there are two other main results. First, I proivde new arguments for a variable-free semantics. For example, it will be shown that under this view the paycheck reading of a pronoun comes for free; most other theories posit additional mechanisms and/or an additional lexical meaning for pronouns, and thus paycheck and regular pronouns are only accidentally homophonous. Second, I reiterate one of the central points in Jacobson (1977): this is that the first pronoun in a Bach-Peters sentence is indeed a paycheck pronoun, and hence nothing special needs to be said about these sentences nor does any new machinery need to be invoked for them.},

	Abstract = {The above quote suggests [from Chomsky 1993] that there may be two distinct positions in which the Case feature of the subject may be checked: Spec-AgrSP, following raising of tense to Agrs, or Spec-TP. In this paper I examine data from Scandinavian, and English to some extent, and argue that both options are made available by the theory but they are not available in all languages. I present an analysis which examines the interaction between verb movement and subject Case-checking and claim that Spec-TP is only available in languages with overt verb raising to T. In those languages Spec-TP is available as a Case checking position for the subject in finite clauses and also as an intermediate position in non-finite clauses (complements of raising verbs and ECM [accusative with Infinitive] verbs) where the subject can check the EPP feature of a non-finite clause but not check its Case. In this sense the paper suggests a refinement of checking theory with respect to subjects.},

	Abstract = {In this article, I report an experimental study that examines the role that Universal Grammar (UG) plays in the early stages of the acquisition of Japanese as a second language (L2) by adult learners. The study addresses the issue of whether a non-parametrized principle of UG that is instantiated in the first language (L1) is "active enough" in the early stages of L2 learning to apply to phenomena for which there are no counterparts in the L1. The phenomenon investigated here involves case partcle deletion in Japanese. The nominative case and accusative case contrast in terms of their omissibility -- the latter can be freely dropped, whereas the former cannot. This contrast is regulated by the Empty Category Principle -- a principle that exists in essentially the same form in English but that applies to a very different set of phenomena in that language. Not only did the L2 learners exhibit a statistically significant difference in the deletability of the nominative and accusative cases, consistent witht he UG prinicple, their perfomance was not significanlty different from that of a native speaker control group. The results point toward the conlusion that UG is operative in second-language acquisition and that nonparametrized principles are active enough to apply to an enteirely new phenomenon.},

	Abstract = {The present paper investigates the phenomenon of "inflected complementizers" seen in many Continental West Germanic dialects. The proposal developed takes as its point of departure the commonality of linear distribution between inflected complementizers and finite verbs that exhibit the same kind of special morphology. The commonality manifests itself in implicational relationships, which strongly suggest that the behavior of complementizers is an analogical extension of morphological mergers involving finite verbs in teh same linear position. Under this analysis, the occurrence of inflectional markings on wh-phrases in embedded complementizer-less questions and relative clauses can be seen as a straightforward extension of the same mechanism. We further propose a concrete implementation of this proposal in Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, which builds on Zwicky's distinction between morphological FORM and SHAPE. Finally, we argue that the approach based on analogical extensions of shape alternations is better suited to motivate the emergence of the phenomenon than current proposals that assume a universal agreement relationship between complementizers and subjects, regardless of whether that agreement relation is overtly manifested.},

	Abstract = {The possibility of null subjects in a language has been attributed to the pronominal character of its Agreement morphology. Instead of considering a pronominal Infl as the licenser adn/or identifier of the empty pronoun pro, I will analyze the Agreement morphemes as independent D items in the numeration, containing case and phi-features. They are merged with verbs inflected for tense as their external arguments. Attracted to T by its strong D-feature, Agreement raises to T, checking its case and phi-features. As a consequence Spec of T is not projected. Lexical subjects and strong pronouns are in a higher projection, where they get a "default" nominative case. Non-pronominal Agreement languages will have weak pronouns merged with a fully inflected verb and will exhibit subject pronouns doubled by a strong pronoun, a phenomenon not visible when the subject is the Agreement itself. The empirical evidence of this analysis will be provided by diachronic facts from Old French and Modern Brazilian Portuguese, which show that the loss of null referential subjects correlates with the impoverishment of person distinctions in their Agreement system and with the emergence of a paradigm of weak pronominals. The analysis also suggests how to analyze null subjects in emerging grammars.},

The analysis is crucially rests on the independently motivated single constituent structure of extended nominal phrases (see Kamio (1983), Terada (1990)). Within this analysis, various contrasts involving the scrambling of numerals, approximate numerals, and quantifiers (leaving behind their associated noun phrases), which have thus far resisted a principled explanation, are shown to be deducible from a natural interaction of two independently motivated analyses: (i) the proper Binding Condition analysis (see Saito (1989, 1992)) and (ii) the Mapping Hypothesis analysis (see Diesing (1992)).},

	Abstract = {Thie proprepositional complementizers 'de'/'di'/'to' in French, Italian and English enter the derivation above the VP, and not as sister to the IP they are associated with. The relation between complementizer and IP is expressed by having the IP move from within VP to the specifier position of the complementizer. That movement can be thought of in terms of Chomsky's (1995: chap. 4) notion of attraction. Subsequent raising of the complementizer (to a head W), followed by phrasal movement to Spec, W, produces the observed word order in these languages. This kind of derivation (which should be generalized to many prepositions) is similar to those proposed in Kayne (1993; 1998) for various constructions involving possession, negation, 'only'/'even'/'too', focus, scope and antecedent contained deletion. Many syntactic relations that could at first glance be expressed in terms of merger (sisterhood) turn out to be better expressed in terms of attraction.},

We discuss the limitations of a standard algorithm for OT learning and outline how the GLA attempts to overcome these limitations. We point out a number of serious shortcomings with the GLA (a) A methodological problem is that the GLA has not been tested on unseen data, which is standard practice in computational language learning. (b) We provide counterexamples, that is, attested data sets that the GLA is not able to learn. (c) Essential algorithmic properties of the GLA (correctness and convergence) have not been proven formally. (d) By modeling frequency distributions in the grammar, the GLA conflates the notions of competence and performance. Thsi leads to serious conceptual problems, as OT crucially relies on the competence/performance distinction.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the syntax of comparative deletion and comparative subdeletion in English and argues that the apparently paradoxical behavior of these two types of clausal comparative constructions is due to a derivational distinction between them: comparative deletion involves overt movement plus deletion of a compared phrase, while comparative subdeletion involves covert movement of the compared phrase. Although this derivational difference must be stipulated in standard approaches, it follows from general constraints on the relation between movement and deletion in English in a model of syntax in which syntactic constratins are ranked and violable, and well-formedness is determined by evaluating competing representations against the set of constraints, as in Optimality Theory. The analysis receives independent support from the interaction of comparatives and ellipsis, and achieves a higher level of descriptive and explanatory adequacy than alternative analyses that do not make reference to ranked violable constraints.},

	Abstract = {Comparaties are among the most extensively investigated constructions in generative grammar, yet comparatives involving attributive adjectives have received a relatively small amount of attention. This paper investigates a complex array of facts in this domain that shows that attributive comparatives, unlike other comparatives, are well-formed only if some type of ellipsisoperation applies within the comparative clause. Incorporating data from English, Polish, Czech, Greek, and Bulgarian, we argue that these facts support two important conclusions. First, violations of Ross's Left Branch Condition that involve attributive modifiers should not be accounted for in terms of constraints on LF representations (such as the Empty Category Principle), but rather in terms of the principle of Full Interpretation at the PF interface. Second, ellipsis must be analyzed as deletion of syntactic material from the phonologica representaiton. In addition, we present new evidence from pseudogapping constructions that favors an articulated syntax of attributive modificaiton in which certain types of attributive modifiers may occur outside DP.},

In order to verify the place of articulation of Korean affricates, I reconsider some previous phonological accounts of their place of articulation and argue that Korean affricates are neither palato-alveolar nor alveolopalatal. By reveiweing phonetic studies of Kroean consonants (e.r., Skalickova, 1960; Kim., 1997, 1998a, 1998b, 1999) and other languges' coronal consonants, I show that the plain affricate /c/ is alveolar like the other coronal consonants in Korean, not post-alveolar, in support of my phonological arguments.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a lexicalist analysis of negation in French and English. In both languges, negation in finite clauses is grammatically distinguished from constituent negation. Lexical idiosyncracy motivates treating finite negation as a verbal complement, while constituent negation is treated in terms of a familiar modifier-head construction. General priniciples ordering lexical and phrasal heads ensure that negation (the adverbs not and pas) follows the finite verb (the finite auxiliary verb in English), while only constituent negation appears preverbally. Our constraint-based account, cast within the framework of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, provides a viable alternative (with broader coverage, fewer devices and simpler principles) to analyses based on head movement, which seek to explain the syntax of negation and adverbial positions in terms ofhte interaction of morphological properties, verb movement, and functional projections.},

In this article, however, I present evidence against the standard analysis and argue that parasitic gaps are incompatible with multiple quantifications that undergo absorption at LF. This evidence is important because it shows that hte set of operators that enter into chain composition must all be homogeneous in terms of operator structures and operator types, and that, crucially, this homogeneity condition on compound chains must hold at LF. I then discuss certain predictions of this LF account of parasitic gaps as well as issues and questions pertaining to the licensing of parasitic gaps in a broader cross-linguistic context.},

This article thus argues that null NPs in these languages must be empty phrase-markers underlyingly, not empty pronouns per se, and hence, their reference properties can be determined only at LF after reconstruction. It is shown that this analysis also promises to solve certain binding-theoretic puzzles that null argument phenomena have posed.},

We apply a set of diagnostics drawn from the Romance literature and find that, for this particular feature, the Newfoundland variety patterns like Standard French and not like the other varieties of Canadian French, that is, subject clitics behave like syntactic subjects. We argue that historical developments related to number marking have resulted in crossdialectal variation in French subject clitic systems. This conclusion is supported by the quantitative analysis of subject clitic use in present-day French dialects.},

The data pertaining to indeterminate pronoun binding, coupled with the data on focus particles, reveal that in Japanese, checking configurations are established in LF. LF movement employed for Case checking is argued to involve the raising of a phrasal category, on the basis that it displays properties different from those of nonphrasal movement in LF. The newly attested data from Japanese lead to the conclusion that constituents can be reordered after "narrow" syntax and that strict locality is required for checking to take place, contrary to Chomsky's (2000, 20001) proposal.},

The proposed analysis of such scope phenomena also reveals significant redundancy between feature-checking operations (independently motivated within the minimalist program) and the (widely assumed) LF-rule QUANTIFIER RAISING (May 1977, 1985), suggesting that QUANTIFER RAISING is (at least partially) eliminable.},

	Abstract = {This paper contains a descriptive analysis of the various ways in which the sole arguments of intransitive predicates are linked to (morpho)syntax in Kambera, a little-known Austronesian langauge spoken in eastern Indonesia. The single argument of Kambera intransitives can be marked by five different pronominal clitic combinations, each of the constructions expressing a differenct contextual property. One of the constructions is the absolutive construction, in which an intransitive subject is either obligatorily or optionally treated like a transitive object ('fluid-S marking', Dixon 1979, 1994). An analysis of the possible origin, structure and contextual propoerties of Kambera fluid-S marking will be given and it will be proposed that in general the morphosyntactic expression of intransitive arguments is not lexically determined nor based on syntactic information coded in the lexical entry but rather depends on teh context in which the verb is used. The Kambera facts will be related to the qauestion of which information the lexical entry of an intransitive is universally supposed to contain, in particular, whether or not that information should be syntactically relevant.},

	Abstract = {Chinese has a number of particles such as le, guo, zai and zhe that add a particular aspectual value to the verb to which they are attached. There have been many characterisations of this value in the literature. In this paper, we review several existing influential accounts of these particles, including those in Lie and Thompson (1981), Smith (1991), and Mangione and Li (1993). We argue that all these characterisations are intuitively plausible, but none of them is precise. We propose that these particles serve to mark which part of a sentence's descriptive content is asserted, and that their aspectual value is a consequence of this function. We provide a simple and precise definition of the menaings of le, guo, zai and zhe in terms of the relationship between topic time and time of situation, and show the consequences of their interaction with different verb expressions within this new framework of interpretation.},

The antecedent of this reflexive anaphor must satisfy a semantic condition which requires consideration of the thematic lexical entailments. The model-theoretic nature of this constraint suggests that the range of semantic informaiton relevant to syntactic processes goes beyond the formal configuration of semantic metalanguages. It also shows that the semantic conditoins which anaphors can impose on their antecedents are not restricted to thematic ranking or center of perspective restrictions. An analysis of the construction within Head-driven Phrase-Structure Grammar is provided.},

	Abstract = {This paper argues against a hypothesis commonly assumed in Romance linguistics, namely, that the thematic hierarchy Possessor < Agent < Theme regulates de-phrase extraction out of hte (French) noun phrase. I proposed that de-phrase asymmetries (in the domain of extraction and in other domains) correlate with an independently motivated semantic partition -- one between individual-denoting phrases (IDPs) that pick out an entity in discourse, and property-denoting phrases (PDPs) that determine a type of entity. I put forward the Nominal Denotation Hypothesis (NDH): at moset one de-phrase of each type can be associated with a given noun (n) head. I subsequently demonstrate (a) that a number of problematic exceptions to the thematic hierarchy can be directly accounted for under NDH, (b) that further facets of de-phrase behaviour bearing on matters of general distribution, aspect, linear order, definiteness/specificity, and the potential/lack of potential for exhibiting scopal ambiguity (which were not accounted for in previous works relying ont he thematic hierarchy) also originate in NDH, and (c) that NDH is nonetheless compatible with certian fundamental aspects of previous approaches (in both derivational and lexicalist frameworks).},

The scope inversion in this reading can be derived from general principles of scope assignment and focus marking in German. In particular, focus is assigned to preverbal constituents, leading to syntactic configurations that result in ambiguous interpretations. This explanation must be couched in a framework of derivational economy that favors shorter derivations. The relevant comparison class is defined with respect to phonological form, not, as has been suggested for English, with respect to identity of semantic interpretation; this may be a general property of "free" word order languages},

Which dish did every guest bring? can be understood as: 'For every guest x: which dish did x bring?'. After a review of previous approaches that tried to caputre this quantification formally or to explain it away, it is argued that such readings involve quantification into speech acts. As the algebra of speech acts is more limited than a Boolean algebra -- it only contains conjunction, not disjunction or negation -- it is predicted that only universal quantifiers can scope out of questions or other speech acts. The approach is extended to indirect questions, which either are embedded speech acts or coerced to denote the true answers, depending on the embedding verb; in the latter case a Boolean structure results, and we find wide-scope readings of non-universal quantifiers.},

We demonstrate that, contrary to Rizzi's and Ross's claims, the distinctions betwen referential and nonreferential expressions and between arguments and adjuncts do not play any direct role in determining the acceptability status of negative sentences involving extraction. We argue that the phenomenon is primarily controlled by a ban against extracting the focus of negation (irrespective of its referentiality and argument/adjunct status) out of hte scope of the negative element, and by a pragmatic factor that bans questions that solicit uninformative answers.},

The universality of this claim is called into question by the fact that postverbal quantifiers take scope overt preverbal quantifiers in Turkish. This article shows that head-final structures derive the correct scope readings in scrambled clauses in a straightforward and consisten manner, whereas head-initial structures require more coplicated and sometimes contradictory assumptions. This suggests that although some SOV alnguages may be derived as Kayne suggests, others, like Turkish, must truly be head-final.},

Weak pronouns share properties of both Romance-like clitics (adjacency, clustering effects) and full pronouns (non-reduced, free-standing forms). Weak pronouns are analyzed as maximal projections prior to Spellout and as clitics, Xo elements, at LF. In overt syntax, they move as XPs to their Case-checkng position. They move beyond the Case position if that position is not close enough to their LF-host. At LF they move as Xos, i.e. they cliticize and incorporate to a V-related host.
In Hebrew, the clitic host is hte participle (AgrParticipleo) in complex tenses and the verb in Agrso or in Co (inversion) in simplex tenses. In German, the pronouns' LF-host is unique: AgrSo raised to Co. Weak pronouns can form clusters, which are derived by multiple adjunction of the pronouns. Weak pronouns are also subject to an adjacency constraint, as a consequence of the Head Movement Constraint, operative on LF Incorporation.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of negative poloarity itmes (NPs) in Hindi. It is noted that NPIs in this language are composed of a (weak) indefinite plus a particle bhii meaning 'even'. It is argued that the compositional semantics of this combination explains their behavior as NPIs as well as their behavior as free choice (FC) items. I assume that weak Hindi indefinites like ek and koi are to be viewed as a predicate that I call one, a predicate that is true of everything that exists. I further assume that bhii exhibits association with focus with the indefinite, and that this leads to contradictory implicatures in positive contexts. The behavior of these phrases in a variety of syntactic contexts is discussed, including constructions like correlatives. Finally, I provide a comparison with analyses of English any, and discuss the relevance of the analysis presented here for that of any.},

@article{Landau:2001,
	Abstract = {Previous analyses of control in Super-Equi have failed to account for the entire paradigm of relevant cases. A new generalization is stated: Obligatory Control (OC) obtains in extraposition only under psychological predicates. It is argued that extraposition is driven by the requirement that VP-internal clauses be peripheral at PF. This is satisfied by a Causer infinitive which is projected below an Experiencer DP, but not by one projected above a theme/goal DP. Thus extraposition is blocked in the former case and licensed in the latter. Crucially, only when the infinitive is extraposed to an adjunct position (or intraposed to a subject position) can it give rise to Non-Obligatory Control (NOC); this is supported by a correlation between NOC and failure of extraction from the infinitive. It is claimed that in OC an Agree relation is establisehd between the matrix funcitonal head that licenses the controller and an anaphoric infinitival Agr, which raises to the embedded C as a 'free-rider' on T. Since Agree is sensitive to islands, the distributional distinction between OC and NOC reduces to the CED. Failing syntactic identification, the infinitival Agr is licensed as a logophro, explaining some well-known properties of NOC in Super-Equi. The proposed account unifies a wide range of phenomena unrelated under altnerative analyses of control and Super-Equi.},

	Abstract = {this article explores the possibility that the distinction betwen interpretable (valued) and uninterpretable (unvalued) features has grammatical manifestations beyond its role in feature checking. I arge that both selection and lexical insertion are sensitive to this distinction; thus, a head may determine not only which features its complement must bear but also whether they should be interpretable or not. Empirical consequences are explored in Hebrew, where infinitival complements to negative verbs ('refrain', 'prevent') display a number of surprising syntax-semantics correlations. Those are traced to the operation of negative features in the Comp position. The analysis also provides insight into the recalcitrant prevent DP from V-ing construction in English.},

	Abstract = {Procrastinate (Chomsky 1993) favors covert movement; therefore, when movement is overt, it must have been forced to operate "early" by some special requirement, one that Chomsky codes into "strong features." I compare Chomsky's three successive theories of strong features and argue that two ellipsis phenomena, pseudogapping and sluicing, provide evidence bearing on the nature of strong features. I argue that movement or ellipsis can rescue a derivation with strong feature, and I conclude that PF crash is relevant either directly, as in Chomsky 1993, or indirectly, as in the theory presented in Chomsky 1995a augmented by the multiple-chain theory of pied-piping (especially as interpreted by Ochi (1998)).},

	Abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the English interrogative/relative pronoun whom is parallel to him and them in manifesting objective pronominal Case. We argue instead that whom is not CAse-marked along with these pronouns. Rather, its Case marking follows a different paradigm. Whom in modern English derives from a set of extragrammatical rules called 'grammatical viruses'. Speakers call upon such rules to check Case and (possibly) agreement features which the normal system of syntax cannot check but which prestige usage demands. Sentences with whom are typical of sentences resulting from grammatical viruses. Such virus-licensed products have a 'prestige' status, they are not typical of child language, and the intuitions about their use are strikingly different from intuitions about the use of other grammatical elements that they are traditionally claimed to wrok along the lines of. In the latter instance, intuitions about the use of ehom differ markely from intuitions about the use of ACC personal pronouns.},

@article{Lechner:2001,
	Abstract = {In this paper, I defend two hypotheses as to the derivation of phonologically reduced comparative constructions. On the one hand, I present evidence which supports an ellipsis analysis of phrasal comparatives over base-generation approaches. On the other hand, it is argued that the restrictions on deletion in comparatives are exhaustively determined by the principles governing Gapping, Right Node Raising and Across-the-Board movement in coordinate structures. It follows that construction specific reduction operations such as Comparative Ellipsis can be dispensed with. Evidence for these two hypotheses comes from generalizations about the surface shape of the comparative complement and its positional distribution inside the matrix clause. As for the reason why comparatives, which manifest instances of semantic subordination, can be targeted by processes widely held to be restricted to coordinate structures, it is proposed that optional extraposition of the comparative complement establishes a derived comparative coordination, which emulates the syntax of base-generated conjunctions. The results of this study furthermore indicate that (i) comparatives need to satisfy a hitherto unidentified condition which limits possible relations between the head of an empty operator movement construction and the operator, and that (ii) the Coordinate Structure Constraint has to be formulated as a genuinely syntactic restriction.},

It is argued that the concept of Semantic Reconstruction (Cresti 1995, Rullmann 1995) can be fruitfully employed in the derivation of quantifier scope ambiguities in German. Semantic Reconstruction will be demonstrated to be an independently needed strategy of grammar, that is not parasitic on syntactic reconstruction as expressed by Copy Theory (Chomsky 1992). The basic difference between Semantic Reconstruction and syntactic reconstruction will be traced back to their asymmetric availability in scrambling chains: scrambling can be undone only by Semantic Reconstruction.},

	Abstract = {This paper focuses on the structural properties of secondary predication. It is argued, based on an analysis of French depitive and resultative secondary predicates, that secondary predicates are functional projections of the category Gender, they form constituents of their own, and they contain a PRO subject coindexed with a main subject or object. Configurationally, they are of two types: subject-oriented secondary predicates, which are adjoined to VP, and object-oriented secondary predicates, which are adjoined to VP (if resultative) or are sisters of V' (if depictive). Compared with previous analyses of secondary prediateion, the present one corroborates early proposals about the constituency and internal make-up of secondary predicates (Stowell 1981, 1983; Chomsky 1981). The main difference lies in the nature of the constituent itself: it is argued ehre that it is a functional projection, namely GernderP, an proposal which owes much to late 1980s and early 1990s explorations in the nature of syntactic categories. In particular, the present analysis leads to the proposal that Agrs and Agro (Chomsky 1991) should, at least in languages like French, be identified as Person and Gender, respectively. THe lack of productive resultative constructions in French is also addressed.},

Both differences are shown to result from a single structural factor: an empty subject is not permitted in the bare resultative phrase in English. The analysis also accounts for various subtle distinctions between the lexical and bi-clausal resultative constructions inside Chinese. An implicaiton of this theory is that the causal relation in a resultative is computed directly off of the construction and that this computation takes place in different components of language: lexicon, syntax, and the post-syntactic semantics.},

Without an intervening Classifier, it can be realized in N. This analysis captures the fact that the -men type plural morpheme is generally found in classifier languages and the English type plural morpheme in non-classifier languages. The plural analysis of -men also captures many generalizations missing from the traditional "collective" analysis, such as (i) -men can occur with a proper name/pronoun/definite common noun but not a definite expression of the form [Demonstrative + Classifier +N], (ii) a quantity expression [Number + Classifier] can follow a pronoun/proper name with -men but not a common noun with -men, and (iii) a quantify expression cannot precede a nominal with -men.},

This partition is intended to capture the antilocality of the SE anaphors. I argue that appropriate partitioning of anaphors is semantic and not syntactic. Reinhart and Reuland's SELF anaphors are "near-reflexives," interpreted as a representation of their antecedents, whereas their SE anaphors are "pure-reflexives," requiring identity with their antecedents. The antilocality effects with pure reflexives are due to Condition R, a principle requiring reflexivity to be lexically expressed. The Condition R approach correctly accounts for the meanings of the two kinds of anaphors, grouping the near reflexives with pronominals and names, and correctly dissociates semantic reflexivity from the calculation of syntactic binding domains.},

Gapped verbs cliticize on to their complements, while ellipsed VPs cliticize on to the heads of which they are complements.
With this account of the distribution of elliptical elements, the paper also discusses the interpretation of ellipsed VPs, using them as a probe into the structure of lexical items, arguing that forms of the verb be are stored atomically in the mental lexicon and refining Lasnik's "hybrid" treatment of verb morphology.},

Besides normal distributive predicates, it can also occur with certain types of collective predicates. The difficulties of giving a compositional interpretation to constructions of these kids are discussed in detail. I show that we can solve those difficulties if we treat dou as a generalized distribtivity marker in the sense of Schwarzschild (1991, 1996), which distributes over the members of a plurality cover.

This analysis of Chinese bare conditionals lends support to Carlson's approach to bare plurals despite Wilkinson's (1991) criticisms. I also show that an extension of Heim's (1987) analysis of what as 'something of kind x' to Chinese shenme 'what' encouters problems when shenme 'what' is a shared constituent of a predicate which applies to kinds and antoher predicate which applies to objects.},

This paper considers the ba construction from an aspectual point of view. I argue that the ba predicate describes a bounded event. Whether an event is bounded in Chinese may depend on situation type only, or it may depend on both situation type and the aspect a situation is rpesented in. As for the ba NP, it is specific in the sense of Liu (1990). I further argue that the two properties -- boundedness and specificity -- are related. There is a dependency between the ba argument denotations and the event described by the predicate, and this dependency can be characterized in terms of a structure-preserving funciton -- a homomorphism. The relation preserved is the 'all of' relation. On this view boundedness and spcificity are simply different manifestations of the same property that is inherent in the meaning of a ba predicate. The ba construction is thus shown to be an example of how aspectual considerations constrain both the predicate and an NP argument in Chinese.},

	Abstract = {This article presents the results of an investigation inot the acquisition of syllable structure and stress by one Dutch child, Joost, between age 1;8 and 2;11. In the first half of the article we show how the structure of the child's output approaches the adult models in stages. Our findings rely to a considerable extent (and therefore confirm) the current parametric account of Dutch wordstress. The latter theory provides prepresentations that, to a strking degree, are adequate for a description of three acquisitional stages in our data: monosyllabic words, polysyllabic words, and words containing the accurate adult number of syllables. Output such as 'nat', 'ojnat', and 'ojinat' for olifant represent precisly these three stages. The first of these examples shows that the child is right-oriented in his monosyllabic stage, selecting rightmost stressed (gridmarked) syllables. Words then become longer by the addition of further syllables that are gridmarked in the metrical representaitons. Finally, the adult stage is reached in which all target syllables are rrepresented. The second part of this article concerns a phenomenon we call mutation. In mutation, all continuants are consistently replaced witn n- in onsets. We show how this phenomenon depnds on both syllable structure and stress, discuss the possible role of exhaustive footing and strict binarity of feet, and present evidenc for the view that its details provide support for a Stress-to-Weight principle, which is currently under discussion in the metrical literature.},

The interaction of positional faithfulness and markedness is shown to result in laryngeal neutralization. Regressive assimilation is shown to be a result of the interaction of positional faithfulness with a constraint preferring adjacent obstruents to agree in voicing. Rerankings of the proposed constraints account for attested pataterns of voicing assimilation and neutralization: unlike previous neutralization and spread analyses, this approach makes the correct prediction that it is equally natural for voicing assimilation in clusters to combine with either devoicing of or retention of voicing distinctions in word-final consonants. It is argued that the interactions of these constraints account for why voicing assimilation is always regressive unless special circumstances hold.},

These are all and only the possibilities expected under recent restrictive theories of phrase structure, like the one advocated by Kayne (1994), and are exactly those empirically realized. Evidence for this conclusion is based primarily on the (existential/generic) interpretation of bare nouns and overt indefinites and is reinforced by extraction considerations. The whole analysis, based on the interpretation of Romance indefinites, is likely to support some version of Diesing's (1992) Mapping Hypothesis even more strongly than previous types of evidence did, including the original data from Germanic languages.},

	Abstract = {Current theories place very mild constraints on possible diachronic changes, somehting at odds with ethe trivial observations that actual "language change" represents a tiny fraction of the variation made a priori available by Universal Grammar. Much recent work in diachronic syntax has actually been guided by the aim of describing changes (e.g., parameter resetting), rather than by concerns of genuine explanation. Here I suggest a radically different viewpoint (the Inertial Theory of diachronic sytnax), namely, that syntactic change not provably due to interference should not occur at all as a primitive -- that is, unless ofrced by changes in the phonology, the semantics, or the lexicon, perhaps ultimately by interface or grammar-external pressures, in line with the minimalist enterprise in synchronic linguistics. I concentrate on a single case, the etymology of Modern French chez, showing how the proposed approach attains a high degree of explanatory adequacy.},

@article{Longobardi:2001,
	Abstract = {One of the two central suggestions put forth in Longobardi (1991, 1994) was that Romance/English differences in the syntax of proper names were parametrically connected to supposed differences in teh semantics of bare (plural and mass) common nouns (BNs). The present article will pursue this line of investigation, trying to make precise such meaning differences and to understand the reason for their apparently surprising parametric association with the syntax of proper names.
It will be shown that in most Romance varieties BNs, unlike their English coutnerparts, distribute their existential and generic readings across all different contexts exactly like (Romance and English) overt indefinties. All the differences will be unified under the proposal that Romance BNs are nothing but a type of indefinites (variables, existentially or generically bound) in Kamp-Heim's DRT sense, while English BNs are rather systematically ambiguous between this quantificational interpretation and a referential (i.e. directly kind-denoting, much in the spirit of Carlson 1977a,b) one, providing for another type of generic reading.
The analysis will therefore crucially exploit and empirically support Gerstner and Krifka's (1987) distinction between referential and quantificational genericity. On such grounds we will finally gain a conceptual understanding of the typological implication originally established in Longobardi (1991, 1994), thus confirming that the strategies of interpretation of nominals, whether proper or common nouns, are basically one and the same, though differently parametrized in different languages. This result, in turn, will shed some light on the question whether comparative semantics is possible and whether it can be singled out as a legitimate independent component of parametric theories of grammatical variation.},

This is best explained by assuming that a liquid articulation was used in the northern Chinese dialect that Koreans took as a model. That articulation was probably a flap [r], and it was part of the general erosion of the final stops that led to their gradual loss in northern Chinese. Sino-Korean offers no evidence for weakening of the labial stop, but a few aberrant loans may point to a weakened form of the velar.},

	Abstract = {Hypothetical infinitives behave like finite cluases: they license lexical NP and pro in subject position and display atmospheric verbs. These properties follow from the interaction between checking procedures (that is, V-to-I-to-C movement) and the location of the hypothetical infinitive in the sentence structure (that is, base-generated in Topic position). In this specific configuration, the effect of [+V] features on Tense combines with the modal feature of Complementizer and ensures finiteness to this clause, despite the infinitive form of the verb. This analysis offers a uniform account for hypothetical infinitives in Quebec and Continental French. It also predicts that cross-linguistic variation (for example, internal licensing of pro in subject position in Quebec French versus Continental French) must concern parametric settings (for example the Null Subject Parameter) which would further interact with the structural conditions of high infinitives discussed in this paper.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines a phenomenon of Niuean (Oceanic) often called Noun Incorporation (NI). It is shown that, since nominal element in these constructions is a phrase (NP) rathern than a head (N), this phenomenon does not in fact constitute NI in the normal sense of the term. Instead, it is termned Pseudo Noun Incorporation, or PNI. An analysis is presented in which an object NP (rther than DP) is generated adjacent to a verb. Since NP cannot check absolutive case, it fails to move out of VP, hence it undergoes predicate fronting along with the verb to derive the 'incorporated' order V-O-Particles-S-X: the normal order is V-Particles-S-O-X. The properties of three subtypes of PNI are examined in some detail: general PNI. existential PNI, and instrumental PNI, and the analysis is developed to account for their properties. General PNI involves the generation of an NP object, in which the referential position remains open, resulting in a habitual reading for the sentence. Instrumental PNI is similar, except it does not have the same aspectual consequence. In existential PNI, on the other hand, an existential verb (fai 'have/be', muhu 'have plenty/be plentiful') binds the position in NP, thus allowing the NP to be referential and to be modifed by a relative clause. Existential PNI thus results from a hybrid V/DET category (such as fai) which simultaneously beinds the open position in NP and acts as the head predicate of the sentence. We see that the properties of Niuean PNI do not fit into the various typologies of NI available in the literature, hence a novel analysis is required, such as the one proposed in this paper.},

	Abstract = {This paper argues, on the basis of data from St'{\'a}t'imcets (Lillooet Salish), for a theory of wide-scope indefinites which is similar, though not identical, to that proposed by Kratzer (1989). I show that a subset of St'{\'a}t'imcets indefinites takes obligatory wide scope with respect to if-clauses, negation and modals, and is unable to be distrbuted over by quantificational phrases. These wide-scope effects cannot be accounted for by movement, but require an analysis involving choice functions (Reinhart 1995, 1997). However, Reinhart's particular choice function analysis is unable to account for the St'{\'a}t'imcets data. A Kratzer-style theory, on the other hand, accounts not only for the wide-scope effects, but also for the emergence of narrower-than-widest interpretations for indefinites which contain bound variables. I depart from Kratzer's analysis in claiming that St'{\'a}t'imcets choice function indefinites are not 'specific'; the discourse context does not provide a value for the function variable. Therefore, I utilize wide-scope existential closure over choice functions rather than leaving the variables free. However, my analysis provides support for Kratzer's claim that Enlgish indefinites are ambiguous between a choice function interpretation and a quantificational interpretation, since St'{\'a}t'imcets determiners overtly encode the English ambiguity. I conclude by suggesting that the proposed analysis of wide-scoep indefinites may be universally valid.},

	Abstract = {The standard analysis of quantification says that determiner quantifiers (such as every) take an NP predicate and create a generalized quantifier. The goal of this paper is to subject these beliefs to crosslinguistic scrutiny. I begin by showing that in St'at'imcets (Lillooet Salish), quantifiers always require sisters of argumental type, and the creation of a generalized quantifier from an NP predicate always proceeds in two steps rather than one. I then explicitly adopt the strong null hypothesis that the denotations of quantifiers should be crosslinguistically uniform. Since the Salish data cannot be captured by the usual analysis of English, I pursue the idea that English is reducible to the Salish pattern. Reanalysis of many English constructions is required. I argue that the reanalysis has advantages over the standard analysis for partitives, as well as for non-partitive all- and most-phrases, which I analyze as containing bare plurals of argumental type. Even where the new analysis faces some challenges (for example, with every), the attempt still leads to fruitful results. It forces us to view familiar constructions in a new light, and to redefine, I believe correctly, which quantificational constructions are 'basic' and which stand in need of further explanation.},

First, the shape differences between phases are quite diverse, involving resyllabificaiton, deletion, umlaut, and metathesis. Second, the phase alternation produces prosodic structures that are otherwise unattested in this language, replacing simple (C)V syllables with closed and diphthongal ones. In this article, I argue that Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993) helps to make sense of both these observations.

@article{McCarthy:1997,
	Abstract = {Similar phonological processes can be governed by different constraints. Davis (1995) claims that the effect of such process-specific constraints cannot be obtained in Optimality Theory (OT), exemplifying this point with material from harmony in Palestinian Arabic. On the contrary, I show that process-specific constraints are a natural and expected result of constraint ranking, the fundamental idea of OT. Furthermore, OT makes a restrictive prediction, the subset criterion, about coexistent process-specific constraints within a single grammar -- a prediction supported by the Palestinian material.
Davis also presents evidence that epenthetic segments have featural specifications, claiming that OT says they are featureless. This is incorrect; OT is a model of constraint interaction, not of the representation of epenthetic segments.},

The quantifier all, though construed with a fronted wh-pronoun, may appear in a position considerably to the right of that pronoun. It is argued that all so stranded marks a position through which a wh-phrase has passed or in which a wh-phrase originates. The construction then provides visible evidence for intermediate derivational stages. This evidence is used to develop a new argument for successive cyclicity and to argue for overt object shift in English and for an origin site for subjects strictly within VP and below the object shift position.},

	Abstract = {Verb agreement in sign languages (illustrated here by Israeli Sign Language, ISL) seems to differ greatly from that of spoken languages, as it seems to be thematically oriented and is realized morphologically only on a subset of verbs int he language. These properties present both typological and theoretical challenges, since agreement is generally regarded as a structural relation, realized morphologically as inflectional affixes on the verbal element. These challenges are addressed here by applying a particular componential analysis (along the lines of Jackendoff 1990) to the class of verbs which inflect for agreement in ISL. This analysis enables us to capture and explain the similarities as well as differences between the agreement systems of signed and spoken languages. It argues that agreement is basically a structural relation in languages in both modalities. The unique properties of sign language verb agreement are attributed tot he difference in the agreeing element: verbs and auxiliaries in spoken languages vs. a spatial predicate in sign languages. These conclusions have some significatn theoretical implications, both for capturing aspects ofthe interaction between modality and the structure of language, and for imposing restrictions ont he structure of the lexicon.},

	Abstract = {The French clitic system has posed a persistent challenge to transformational syntactic analysis, which has never produced a successful account of problems such as clitic ordering. Lexicalist alternatives, however, have never been reconciled with the full range of familiar problems and the growing body of known lexical idiosyncracies. We presetn a lexicalist treatment of the French clitic system that treats all 'clitics' as lexical pronominal affixes, whose ordering is templatic in nature. On our account, the order of French pronominal affixes is independent of the general properties of syntactic structures; cliticized words -- treated as valence-reduced realizations of verbal lexemes -- enter the syntax fully inflected. The conclusions we reach challenge grammatical architectures that seek to explain the behavior of clitics in terms of functional projections, head movement and/or the Mirror Principles.},

The "free-word-order" view is, to some extent, a carryover from the nonconfigurational conception of such languages. For VP-internal word order permutation, the two word orders IO-DO and DO-IO are best viewed as being base-generated instead of as being derived one from the other. For IP-adjunction scrambling, A-scrambling is driven by a Case agreement feature, whereas A'-scrambling is motivated by something like focus. These findings cast doubt on the widely held view that scrambling constitutes a strictly optional movement.},

For the majority of verbs, the paper argues for a partialized version of the intensional quantifier analysis originally proposed by Montague, but for a single class of verbs, verbs of comparison, it adopts the property analysis recently proposed as a general analysis of intensional verb constructions by Zimmermann (1992).

	Abstract = {This paper presents evidence from Turkish Raising Constructions that argues that A-chains should potentially terminate in a pronominal element. This is motivated by the possibility of raising from finite clauses in some varieties of Turkish. However, these Raising constructions do exhibit Specified Subject Condition effects, arguing for a theory of the locality of movement that dissociates the prohibition against raising from finite clauses from the prohibition against crossing a specified subject. I argue that Rizzi's (1990) Relativized Minimality approach achieves this separation as a consequence of separate conditions on formal licensing and chian locality. In particular, I propose that Turkish Raising construcitons involve an A-chain whose tail is a silent pronominal (pro). Given that this type of Raising leaves a pronominal copy, neither Principle A of the Binding theory, nor the ECP can be involved (as these apply to only [-pronominal] elements). However, if antecedent government is taken to be a property of chains, as Rizzi proposes, then locality will correctly be enforced in these Copy-Raising cases. This approach is extended to Exceptional Case Marking/Subject to Object Raising constructions, and provides an argument for a Subject to Object Raising analysis. I conclude by briefly comparing the resumptive pronoun strategy in A- and A'-dependencies. From a cross-linguistic perspective, it appears that both allow for a relaxation of ECP effects as well as the mitigation of locality to varying degrees.},

@article{Moore:2000,
	Abstract = {What are Dative Subjects? This paper argues that this term has been applied to two distinct constructions. In one, the surface subject is in the dateive case. In the other, a dative-marked nominal that behaves like a subject in certain respects is not, we claim, a surface subject. Dative nominals of the second type have been analyzed in Relational Grammar as initial subject and final indirect object in the Inversion construction; for the reason we call them I-nominals. Neither adopting nor rejecting the initial-subject analysis of I-nominals, here we argue only that they are not surface subjects.
To argue that I-nominals are not surface subjects is not so straightforward, however. Where I-nominals fail to behave like surface subjects, it has been widely assumed that the subject behaviors in question are restricted to nominative subjects. This has made it possible to maintain tha tI nominals are surface subjects despite their nonsubject behaviors, which are attributed to their dative case. To argue against this it is necessary to find a langauge where Inominals' failure to behave like subjects cannot be attributed to their dative case.
Here we argue that Russian is such a language. We show that Russian has a true dative-subject construction in which surface subjects are in the dative case. They behave like subjects in every respect. Russian also has I-nominals in the dative case which behave like subjects in only two respects; in other respects they fail to behave like subjects. This failure cannot be attributed to their dative case becasue true dative subjects, also in the dative case, behave like subjects in every respect. We conclude that dative subjects and I-nominals instantiate distinct constructions which must be recognized as such in syntactic typology and syntactic theory.
The consequences of this result extend beyond Russian to the analysis of other languages. Where dative-marked nominals behave like subjects in certain respects, it is necessary to determine whether they are I-nominals or dative subjects, based on language-internal evidence. They cannot simply be assumed to be dative subjects, as has often been done. It takes more to be a dative subject than has generally been recognized: it takes language-internal evidence that nominals in question are not I-nominals.},

	Abstract = {Movement is a specific property of human languages and one that has at least implicitly been recognized in all linguistic theories. The most recent development posits that movement is forced by morphological requirements (Chomsky 1995). In this paper I will suggest a different approach to movement, suggesting that it is essentially related to the geometry of phrase structure. A weak version of Kayne's 1994 theory of the antisymmetry of syntax, namely 'dynamic antisymmetry' will be introduced. In the strong version, UG only allowed for antisymmetrical configurations, in terms of c-command. Within dynamic antisymmetry, however, symmetrical configurations can be generated, provided that movement makes them antisymmetric before spell-out. In other words, I will suggest that movement is a symmetry-breaking phenomenon, i.e. it is triggered by purely geometrical factors as opposed to morphological ones. Data will range from small clause constructions (both in copular sentences and believe-type verbs) to wh-movement in interrogatives. Italian and English will be the major sources of examples.},

This apper argues that [focus] features enter the grammar in conjunction with [wh] and [tense]. Complex [wh/focus] and [tense/focus] features induce contrastive configurations and crosslinguistic variation. Romanian constructions with preverbal focus are compated with English clefts, and point to a parametric approach: languages display different strategies for overt movement to focus according to their parametric setting for [wh/focus] or [tense/focus]. The analysis of [focus] as syntactically dependent on [wh]/[tense] provides a uniformtreatment for important variation in focus constructions (e.g. preposing through clitic doubling chains versus clefting) and in interrogative clauses (e.g. presence versus absence of V2 effects in embedded interrogatives).},

	Abstract = {In this paper I discuss three different types of asymmetries found in coordinate structures and their implications for the phrase structure of coordination. There are, broadly speaking, three kinds of syntactic analyses of coordination in the literature. In some recent work, coordinate structures are analysed using only clausal coordination and "conjunction reduction" via deletion (E.g. Wilder 1994, Schwarz 1998). In other work, it is argued that conjuncts occupy the specifier and complement of a conjunction phrase (e.b. Munn 1987, Kayne 1994, Johannessen 1996). In parallel structures approaches (Goodall 1987, Moltmann 1993, Wilder 1998), single constituents are often "shared" by two conjuncts. I will argue that coordination asymmetries provide evidence against such accounts and will argue for an analysis in which conjunction is analysed syntactically as phrasal adjunction (Munn 1992, 1993).},

@article{Murray:1998,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a criticism of Ham's (1998) Optimality Theoretic treatment of West Germanic gemination. Ham attempts to revise Murray and Vennemanns (M\&V 1983) analysis in which all cases of gemination are motivated by the sonority profile at syllable contact in accordance with Cyllable Contact Law (SCL). Although Ham accepts the relevance of SCL, he claims that two additional constraints are required. I demonstrate, however, that neither constraint can be motivated for the grammar of West Germanic. Indeed, from a diachronic perspective the only function of the additional constraints is to serve as ad hoc diacritics. Accordinaly, while Ham's analysis might be OT-coherent, it fails to translate into a explanatory account of West Germanic gemination. By contrast, I demonstrate that M\&V's original account was correct in identifying hte sonority profile at syllable contact as the primary motivating factor. The paper also ctouches on the issue of rereanking and phonological change. In the absence of reference to general principles, reranking does not 'explain' diachronic' change in any interesting way.},

The most drastic effects show up in past tense individual-level clauses (section 1). I argue in section 2 that predicates provide lexically determined minimal requirements on their arguments' lifetimes. The role of tense for lifetime effects is an indirect one: by virtue of its determining the temporal interpretation of the main predicate of a clause, it triggers implicatures which cause lifetime effects. This proposal is refined in section 3 so as to be able to explain the blocking of liftetime effects in certain contexts. This blocking is due to the choice of topics and the choice of values for temporal restrictions. In section 4 I compare my proposal to a proposal of Kratzer (1989b) and argue that my account is more adequate. Kratzer's main claim, that the temporal location of individuals is somtimes directly determined by tnese, runs into several problems which are avoided in my account.},

A sequence of two high tones, for example, is avoided in a variety of ways: one of the tones is deleted or retracted away from the other, or the two are fused into a singly high tone. Processes that would create such a sequence are blocked. The problem is how to derive all these different ways of avoiding this configuration from a single principle.
It is argued here that Optimality Theory (OT) provides the means to derive the full range of dissimilatory effects from the OCP, through the ranking of the OCP with Faithfulness constraints. Examples of tonal dissimilation in three Bantu langauges are examined: Shona, Rimi, and Kishambaa. The analysis supports the OT interpretation of constraints as violable and ranked.},

	Abstract = {The case canonically assigned to subjects across languages is nominative or ergative case. In a number of languages including Tamil, Russian, Finnish, Icelandic, Malayalm, and Hindi, subjects can receive dative case marking. This phenomenon, labelled 'quirky' or 'lexical' case-marking, is generally accounted for in terms of the association of dative case with an argument bearing a particular thematic role in the lexical entries of individual verbs (Zaenen, Maling \& Thrainsson 1985). Such an account does not account for all the data, neither does it explain why certain thematic roles should get dative case marking. In this paper, I show that hte case-marking patterns in Hindi can be accounted for in a principled manner in terms of the interaction of the aspectual characteristics of the construction, its adicity, and the relative prominence of the arguments of the verb on the Thematic Hierarchy. My account of this phenomenon is formulated within the framework of Role and Reference Grammar (Foley \& Van Valin 1984; Van Valin 1991, 1993).},

It is used in low communicative tension sections of discourse, when the speaker is transmitting parts of the message that are not presented as the center of attention. This communicative peripherality provides the motivation for a number of properties, ranging from extra-grammatical performance options to strictly formal grammatical conditions. The relevant regularities can be captured in discourse terms because their motivation is to be found in the conditions of language use.},

They are usually analyzed on a par with DP-arguments, with the proviso that the prepositional head is, in some way or other, invisible to theta-theory. Such an analysis must be rejected on the basis of the behavior of PP-complements in predication structures. Instead I propose an analysis in which the verb and the DP contained in a PP-complement are thematically related after abstract incorporation of the preposition. This analysis explains several otherwise mysterious properties of PP-complements. It also provides some evidence for a model of grammar in which thematic relations are not established before LF (contra a GB-style Projection Principle).},

It argues that, at least as far as syntactic constraints are concerned, FOT suffers from severe deficiencies. Such a pairing incorrectly locates the form-function interplay in the mental grammar itself, rather than seeing the response of form to function as emerging from language use and acquisition. Furthermore, FOT seems incompatible with the standard OT assumption that constraints are universal. Finally, two of the functionally-motivated hierarchies that are central to FOT theorizing, the thematic and relational hierarchies, are highly problematic, while incorporating the others into an FOT analysis leads to otherwise unnecessary complexity.},

	Abstract = {It is well known that personal pronouns in Japanese such as kare 'he' and kanozyo 'she', unlike their English counterparts, cannot be construed as bound variables in logical form. The purpose of this article is to argue that this corss-linguistic difference is due to the difference in syntactic categories. English personal pronouns are determiners (Postal 1969), exemplifying what will be referred to as D-Pronouns, and can be construed as bound variables, whereas Japanese personal pronouns are nouns, exemplifying what will be referred to as N-Pronouns, and cannot be so construed. I argue that this follows from a general condition on binding that applies only to functional items, and not to lexical ones. I provide empirical and conceptual support for this hypothesis on the basis of the behavior of such elements as articles, determiners, and demonstrative pronouns as well as that of personal pronouns.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores the consequences of [ATR] harmony in Turkana for the theory of positional faithfulness (Beckman 1997; McCarthy and Prince 1995). I argue that faithfulness to an underlying suffix value ranks higher than faithfulness to an underlying root value. This argument is based on the existence of a set of invariant [+ATR] and a set of invarieant [-ATR] suffixes. These suffixes fail to agree with a preceding root in tongue root position and instead impose their tongue root specification on any vowel that precedes them, subject to the markedness constraints *HI/RTR and *LO/ATR. The invariant suffixes of Turkana are therefore characterized by two of the properties Beckman (1997) lists as a phonological process. I conclude that suffix position must be recognized as linguistically salient in Turkana and sibmit that root faithfulness does not outrank affix faithfulness universally, as suggested by McCarthy and Prince (1995).},

	Abstract = {Although Xo movement places clitics within sentences, ordering within clitic clusters must be readjusted at PF to conform to nonsyntactic ordering requirements. This paper addresses exactly how the conflicting demands of syntactic ordering and purely morphological ordering are mediated, with data from Nunggubuyu (Australia, documented by Heath (1980, 1982, 1984)). Two mechanisms are proposed. First, a pre-Spell-Out deletion of features by means of Impoverishment rules (Bonet 1991, 1995) bleeds the insertion of certain clitics. Impoverishment rules also feed and bleed one another, giving rise to complex surface patterns. Second, clitics which survive Impoverishment must move in Morphology from their abstract (syntactic) position to conform with surface ordering restrictions. Heath formalized these movements as Affix Hopping transformations, but this paper shows that Hopping always local, and can thus be modelled as an instance Morphological Merger (Marantz 1988). Where clitic sequences cannot be properly reordered by local movements, clitic deletion applies as a Last Resort to allow PF convergence. The proposed locality restriction explains a battery of seemingly unrelated clitic deletions in a principled way.},

The crucial aspect of this alternative model is that it permits constrained instances of sidward movement, whereby a given constituent "moves" from a syntactic object K to an indpendent syntactic object L. This version of the copy theory of movement (a) provides an explanation for why (some) traces must be deleted in teh phonological component, (b) provides a cylcic analysis for standard instances of noncyclic movement, and (c) accounts for the main properties of parasitic gap and across-the-board extraction constructions.},

Building on Miyagawa's (1993) analysis, the present paper argues that a genitive phrase raises out of a prenominal gapless clause in either overt or covert syntax. This claim is crucially based on Lasnik's (1999a) analysiso fo Exceptional Case Marking constructions in English, according to which the ECM subject raises into a higher clause either overtly or covertly. It is also demonstrated that when a genitive subject originates in a relative clause, its raising is limited to covert syntax. This non-uniform behavior of the genitive subject is argued to follow from a particular implementation of Attract F.},

It is argued that the relevant sentences do not involve it. This, together with a particular assumption about the properties of so-called D-pronouns n Dutch accounts for all relevant facts in a manner which is compatible with Higgins's Generalization.
Since the validity of Higgins's Generalization for other sentential complements has been established already, it is concluded that it is fully valid for Dutch. It is argued that this generalization can be derived from an analysis of topicalization of sentences as a special case of contrastive dislocation but not from (two varieties of) a topicalization analysis.
A further consequence is that infinitival complements in Dutch cannot be analyzed as subjectless VPs but contain further structure above the VP, and the analysis imposes specific requirements on the nature of certain rules for interpreting pronouns.},

This construction is known to receive at last two distinct interpretations: on-going process interpretations analogous to the English progressive and so-called resultative interpretations. The latter are sub-classified by some researchers into concrete result state readings and experiential state readings. Based upon the distributional properties of adverbials, we suggest that progressive interpretations of DURATIVE VERBS and concrete result state interpretations of INSTANTANEOUS VERBS should be grouped together, as opposed to experiential readings of DURATIVE or INSTANTANEOUS VERBS. To account for the distinction between these two types of interpretation, the proposed system analyzes the -te iru form into the morpheme -te, which is claimed to bear a perfect feature, and the aspectual auxiliary iru. Our proposal for the aspectual auxiliary iru is an extension of Landman's (1992) proposal and offers a unified account of the multiple interpretations of -te iru on the basis of a new analysis of INSTANTANEOUS VERBS.},

The approach will be algebraic in the sense of Link (1983). Informally, our proposal is that while English has only one form of plurality, Papago has two: one based on identity and the other on equivalence. The identity-based plural is one that Papgo shares with English and other Indo-European langauges; the equivalence-based plural, on the other hand, is characteristic of Papgo and other Native American languages. The extreme elaboration of the notion of multiplicity expressed in Papgo follows from this proposal, given sufficiently rich models and independently motivated principles governing hte semantics of roots (Wackernagel 1920; Ojeda 1993; Eschenbach 1993), markedness (Jakobson 1957), and verbs (Davidson 1967; Parsons 1990).},

	Abstract = {Spanish allows its post-verbal subjects to appear in VSO and VOS configurations. It has been generally assumed that the second order is generated by the adjunction of the subject to the right (Rizzi 1982, Torrego 1984, and Su{\~n}er 1994). This paper explores an alternative to this traditional view in which this order is gneerated by the scrambling of the objects to the left. Empirical support in favor of this hypothesis comes from certain syntactic asymmetries between VSO and VOS. Some of these asymmetries reflect the fact that the object c-commands the subject in teh VOS order but not in the VSO order. In other cases, the asymmetries show that certain types of objects cannot move to the left to produce the VOS order. This is the result predicted by the constrained nature of scrambling. Specifically, there is a parallel between these alternations in Spanish and the same ones described in scrambling langauges (e.b., German or Korean) with SOV and OSV alternations. Finally, this hypothesis supports the line of research put forward by Kayne (1994) for word order in UG, according to which right adjunction is not possible.},

In particular, we propose that foot binarity and prosodic word minimality shield vowels of minimally sized words from deletion. On the other hand, when a subminimal word is joined to a form which obeys minimality, its prosodic well-formedness is improved via deletion. Failure of deletion leads to a fatal violation of foot binarity and minimality. Our analysis is then compared with two existing proposals, syllable-based and syntax-induced analyses.},

	Abstract = {The relationship between a reflexive and its antecedent is characterized by (a) a locality condition, and (b) a syntactic prominence condition. In Chomsky (1981) locality is defined in terms of governing category, and syntactici prominence is via c-command. In this article I show that, to account for the long-distance binding properties of complex reflexive ta-ziji '3s-self' in Chinese, properties which cast doubt on "Pica's generalization' that only morphologically simplex reflexives can be long-distance bound, locality should be regulated by a closeness condition. Locality is thus considered a relative rather than a strict condition. I propose that the prominence condition, should be defined in terms of animacy hierarchy for Chinese reflexive ta-ziji. Thus, the interpretation of reflexives in unified not under Chomsky's Binding Condition A, but under the Anaphor Condition proposed in this article, which is defined in terms of closeness and prominence. It is uggested that languages differ only in that their definitions of prominence.},

Given Johnson's (1994, 1996) analysis of verb gapping as ATB movement of the verb to a functional category, the apparent lack of verb gapping in Chinese seems to fit in nicely with another idea prevalent in Chinese linguistics viz., that verb movement is confined to the VP-shell (cf. Huang, 1992, 1994; Tsai, 1994). The present article argues against these claims and provides evidence for the existence of verb gapping -- though restricted -- in Chinese. Furthermore, it shows that Johnson's ATB movement analysis of gapping can be successfully applied to Chinese as well which leads to the typologically important result that the verb in Chinese can --under particular circumstances -- leave the VP and raise to a functional category in overt syntax.},

@article{Platzack:1998,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a structural account of imperative clauses where the theoretical cornerstones are the Minimalist Program of Chomsky (1995) and the analysis of the C-domain in Rizzi (1995). According to Rizzi, the C-domain has at least two parts, the outward facing ForceP, a sentence type projection where information of the type of the clause is represented, and an inward facing part, FinP, related to tense and mood. We argue in this paper that the main difference between imperative clauses and other sentence types is the lack of FinP and hence finiteness in imperative clauses; having no FinP, imperative clauses also lack MoodP and TP. The imperative clause is thus less articulated compared with the declarative and interrogative clauses.
From the lack of FinP follow the three most salient properties of imperative clauses: the morphologically meagre form of the verb, the impossibility of embedding imperative clauses, and the lack of a prototypical subject. The last mentioned fact has the consequence that an imperative clause can never be used to refer to the addressee in the same way as a declarative and interrogative clause can: imperative clauses can only be used to talk TO the addressee, not ABOUT him or her. We support our theoretical approach by empirical evidence drawn mainly from German, English, and Mainland Scandinavian.},

	Abstract = {The article deals with the phonological behaviour of two evaluative suffixes in casual spoken French, namely -ingue and -if. Like many suffixes of this kind, these have variant forms with an initial consonant. My claim is that these initial consonants are epenthetic ones. A study of the environments where these two types of variant are found shows that, setting aside cases where the suffix follows a consonantal cluster, these final variants are in complementary distribution. The rule is that the -ingue variant follows a voiced adn oral coronal consonant and that the if variant is preceded by a voiced or unvoiced oral coronal consonant which is neither /d/ nor /l/. This in fact explains why, whereas these suffixes normally replace the final rhyme of the polysyllabic words to which they attach, we observe cases of concatenation and truncations extending further than a thyme. The cononant-initial variants, which occur when the base word does not contain an appropriate consonant, are themselves in complementary distribution. Finally, we observe that initial consonants of consonant-initial variants form a subset of the consonants which the vowel-initial variants allow in front of them. These facts argue for the existence of output constraints which exclude the occurrence of -ingue and -if in a syllable whose onset does not belong to the above-mentioned consonant classes: the epenthesis has the effect of satisfying these constraints when the base word does not contain an appropriate consonant, and when the presence of a consonant cluster does not preclude this insertion.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents and analyzes a unique pattern of long-distance agreement (LDA) in the Nakh-Daghestanian language Tsez, spokenin the Caucasus. The phenomenon, in which a verb may agree with a constituent inside its clausal complement, poses a serious challenge to theories of agreement locality. In a number of formal syntactic theories, agreement between a head and an argument reflects some very local clause-mate configuration, often specifier-head. We demonstrate that this is inadequate for a satisfactory analysis of LDA and we propose an alternative that appeals to a less local configuration resembling head government. Crucial to our analysis of LDA is the generalization that LDA is triggered by a constituent wich must be a topoic. We argue that the agreement trigger moves covertly to an A' topic position within its own clause where it is in a local agreement configuration with the verb. Independent evidence for covert movement adn the existence of configurations which block LDA support the analysis. The primary conclusion is that syntactic agreement cannot be reduced to a specifier-head configuration in all cases. The theory must allow a less local configuration in which the target simply governs the agreement trigger.},

In backward control two subject arguments are coindexed but it is the higher subject that is unpronounced: e tried [John to leave]. The principles-and-parameters framework (Chomsky and Lasnik 1993) explicitly rules out backward control. In contrast, recent minimalist analyses of control (e.g., Hornstein 1999) permit backward control because they allow movement from one thematic position to another. Backward control results if this movement takes place covertly. We argue that the phenomenon thus provides interesting evidence for the reduction of control to movement.},

Instead, we posit just one type of referentially dependent element -- reflexives -- which avail themselves of two options for being related to their antecedents, namely, syntactic binding adn discourse coreference. We focus on Chinese reflexive ziji but will also consider reflexives in American English and British English. Data from these languages indicate that obligatory binding (as stated in Principle A of Chomsky (1986)) is something of a special case and should not be taken as a general model for a cross-linguistic approach to reflexives. We also show that argument structure is relevant to long-distance binding in Chinese, and thus the syntactic binding domain can be defined in terms of relative OBLIQUENESS of grammatical relations rather than a purely tree-configurational relation, e.g., C-COMMAND.},

It will be shown that a natural extension of Kayne's (1994: 8.6) analysis of de to en sheds light on mysterious properties of en.

Thus any operation that consisted of Move alpha alone, without Form Chain, is cost-free. Prior to the examination of any data, I explore the properties that Move alpha without Form Chain is predicted to possess. I then examine two optional movements, Icelandic Stylistic Fronting and "semantically vacuous" cases of Japanese scrambling, and show that they possess precisely the predicted properties.},

@article{Poplack:1999,
	Abstract = {The hospitality of the future temporal reference sector to multiple exponents is well exemplified by French, wehre the inflected future currently competes with both periphrastic future and futurate present forms. Most scholars contend that the variant expressions are selected accordign to distinctions in the way the speaker envisions the future eventuality and/or the semantic and/or pragmatic import s/he wishes to convey. Curiously, however, there is little agreement as to what that import is nor which of the variants is capable of expressing it. Making use of a variationist approach, in this paper we return to the qeustion of the function and meaning of the major exponents of futurity in spoken French through systematic analysis of thousands of contexts of future emporal reference in natural speech. We show that although the variant forms continue to divide up the work of expressing posteriority, they are rarely selected by speakers in accordance with the values commonly attributed to them in either the descriptive or prescriptive literature. This is because basically all reference to future states or events is made by periphrastic future, which as ousted inflected future from virtually all contexts of productive usage but one, while futurate present has made only incipient incursions into another. We suggest that failure to attain consensus on the set of meanings or functions distinguishing the variatns is the product of an epistemological problem stemming from difficulty in reconciling the form-function polyvalence characteristic of inherent variability with the (distributional) linguistic enterprise of ascribing a unique function to every form.},

	Abstract = {This paper is a detailed investigation of the syntax and semantics of a single type of cross-linguistically common parenthetical expression, here dubbed As-parentheticals (e.g., Ames, as you know, was a spy). I show that a treatment of such clauses as adverbial modifiers combines with a motivated semantic analysis to account for a wide range of ambiguities concerning negation in particular, but also tense, modal, and adverbial operators. I provide a principled explanation for the impossibility of variable binding into, and extraction from, As-parentheticals, and argue that this construction yields novel support for the view (of Ladusaw 1992, and others) that negative DPs like no one are actually non-negated indefinites licensed by an abstract, clause-level negation. Overall, the analysis shows that parentheticals, in addition to being a rich source of puzzles in their own right provide a useful probe into clause structure in general.},

On the basis of aphasic metathesis errors we collected in a single case study, we suggest that roots can be accessed as independent morphological units. We review documented language games and slips of the tongue that lead to the same conclusion. We also discuss evidence for the morphemic status of templates from aphasic erros, language games, and slips of the tongue. We conclude that the available external evidence is best accounted for within a morpheme-based theory of morphology that forms words by combining roots and templates.},

	Abstract = {The forms represented orthographically as (wanna), (gonna), (gotta), (oughta), (usta), and (sposta) have standardly been analyzed as involving a syntactic rule or cliticization operation called to-contraction. Occasionally it has been suggested that the forms in question have been 'lexicalized', i.e., WANNA and HAFTA are synchronically distinct lexemes from WANT and HAVE. I argue here that neither approach is correct. The syntactic accounts are wrong to assume that the relation between wanna and want to must be syntactic, and the lexicalizaiton accoutns are wrong to assume that there is no synchronic relation: the link is one of derivational morphology. A morpholexical rule suffixes /tu/ ~ /te/ tot he base lexcemes to form derived lexemes such as WANNA. These to-derivates are headed morphological structures, as described by Stump 1994. They inflect on their heads, not their edges; they are sysnonymous with their bases but have different subcategorization and more colloquial style associations. Various morphologcial and phonological sharing of the lexical idiosyncrasies of the bse lexemes show that they contain those bases as heads. All the syntactic phenomena that have been claimed to be relevant to the debate overt to-contraction fall into place under the assumptions advocated here, and some new insights emerge, particularly with regard to the 'liberal dialects' where the pronunciation written <wanna> has wider distribution than in most American dialects.},

A suitably restricted form of the notion has been used as a simple and perspicuous basis for the resolution of the meaning of elliptical expressions and for the interpretation of some non-compositional tyipes of comparative construction also involving ellipsis. This paper explores another area of application for this concept in the interpretation of sentences containing intonationally marked 'focus', or various semantic constructs which are snesitive to focus.
Similarities and differences between this approach, and theories using 'alternative semantics', 'structured meanings', or flexible categorial grammars, are described. The paper argues that the higher order unification approach offers descriptive advantages over these alternatives, as well as the practical advantage of being capable of fairly direct computational implementation.},

	Abstract = {The main objective of the present work is to motivate the existence of a class of transitive structures involving the (Romance) clitic se/si in European Portuguese, whose logical object exhibits subject agreement. Structures of this sort have been traditionally analyzed as passive, but we show that in European Portuguese they are active. This is not obvious at first, for in fact the object agreeing withthe verb can prepose in ways which resemble passivization. The first half of this paper is devoted to showing that this preposing is not NP-Movement at all. This in turn leads to a few questions around the peculiarity of the construction: Why does an active object exhibit subject agreement? When and how is this possible? How does this object get licensed? What is the subject of the construction and what are its properties? These questions have an obvious general interest but are particularly significant within the minimalist program of Chomsky (1995b), which has mechanisms ensuring that objects of transitive configuratoins do not move to the position that licenses subject agreement, contrary to what happens in this construction. We express our findings within this framework.},

Based on evidene from French, it is argued that notions such as perfectivity, habituality, and temporal boundedness can have a grammatical impact on the pronominal system of a language. Two formal treatments of this phenomenon are developed: first in terms of the Conceptual Semantic framework of Moens \& Steedman (1988), the second in terms of the model-theoretic framework espoused by Richard Montague and his followers.},

	Abstract = {In the framework of the minimalist program, the assumption that wh-in-situ move covertly to be assigned wide scope is infeasible. Rather, it is assumed that they must be interpretable in situ, and that syntactic conditions like 'superiority' are effects of economy, which restricts overt rather than covrt movement of a wh-element. The remaining syntactic problem for this line of reasoning is the putative ECP effects of adverbial wh-adjuncts, which were the strongest evidence for covert movement. A serious semantic problem is that the interpretative procedures which have been proposed for wh-in-situ -- unselective binding or absorption -- fail to capture correctly their interpretation. I will argue first that both problems are solved if the interpretation in situ employs choice functions, and it is the function variable, rather than an individual variable, which is long-distance bound by the question existential operator. Adverbial adjuncts, which cannot be interpreted via choice functions, cannot, therefore, be interpreted in situ. However, the concept of economy underlying the account of overt superiority effects requires both theoretical and empirical clarification (as it leaves some empirical problems unaddressed). I argue, following a proposal by Golan (1993), that in this case the economy considerations apply at the interface ('interface economy') and that they consider not only different derivations out of the same numeration, but also their semantic representation.},

Locality conditions on binding are shown to follow from this economy principle and independent principles of (minimalist) syntax, providing the means to encode certain dependencies, most economically, within the computational system. It shows that hte role of complex anaphors in licensing reflexivization follows from an interpretive condition holding at the conceptual-intentional interface.},

	Abstract = {Approaches to morphology typically account for regular, completely productive affixation, while ignoring subregular and semiproductive schemata. The alternative approach to derivational morphology presented here relates exceptions and subregularities to productive rules. It accounts for the contribution lexicalized words make to the rule and for the fact that not all new formations follow the 'rules'. It also captures linguistically relevant generalizations that cannot be expressed in other theories. The approach is formalized in terms of complex recursive schemata structured in a multiple inhertance hierarchy, without positing lexical rules or lexical entries for affixes. These schemata structure the existing lexicon, reducing redundancy, and at the same time serve as the basis for productive word formation. The approach handles zero-drivation adn other nonconcatenative morphology straightforwardly.},

	Abstract = {Considerable importance has been attributed to the problem of restricting the theory, but nevertheless certain options that generative transformational grammar provides have remained largely untouched. In the present article, one such issue is broached, viz., that of the choice between substitution adn adjunction. The obvious solution of eliminating one of the two options is rejected on empirical grounds, but for the subdomain of head movement it is possible to formulate a theory which will decide whether a particular instance of head movement is a case of adjunction or of substitution. The crucial factor will be seen to be 'adjacency'. The Head Adjacency Principle (HAP) in effect says that any instance of head movement which does not take place under adjacency must be a case of substitution. Evidnce for this proposal is presented from a variety of langauges and constructions, with particular emphasis on the analysis of the contraction beween prepositions and articles, analyzed as D-to-P Raising, in German.},

@article{Riemsdijk:1998a,
	Abstract = {The question addressed here is whether there is a systematic relationship between the internal structure of syntactic phrases and their distribution in the clause. To account for the internal coherence of syntactic phrases, their endocentricity, I develop the notion of 'extended projections' in two ways. First, evidence from two constructions of German and Dutch argues that in addition to lexical heads and functional heads, also semi-lexical heads must be introduced. The notion of categorial identity, which states that the syntactic nodes connecting the lexical and functional heads within an extended projection with the phrasal node must all be of the same category type, is shown to hold for semi-lexical heads as well. Second, the notion of 'extended projection' will be modified to accommodate the fact that prepositional elements can often be inserted within an extended projection. The exceptional status of prepositional phrases is reminiscent of the fact that prepositional phrases are arguably the most flexible phrases in terms of their distribution. In earlier work, I had suggested that this fact could be expressed in terms of a constraint, the Unlike Feature Cosntraint, which was formulated in terms of repulsion between the positive values of the categorial features: a [+N/V] head does not tolerate a [+N/V] phrase in its immediate domain. Categorial identity is now interpreted as the mutual attraction of the positive categorial featuer values: we have attraction within, but repulsion across phrasal categories. And in both cases, prepositions are the neutral element. This idea leads to aunified principle, the Law of Catetgorial Feature Magnetism.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents data on vowel harmony with disharmonic roots in Finnish which show that when the last harmonic vowel in a disharmonic root is back, in almost all cases the only possible harmonic suffix vowel is back, but when the last harmonic vowel is front, there is usually variation in suffix vowel choice that seems to be influenced by several factors, including sonority and stress. These data, which cannot easily be accounted for in rule-based theories, can be accounted for in Optimality Theory. A highly ranked alignment constraint accounts for harmony with native roots and loans in which the last harmonic vowel is back. Unranked constraints, which tie suffix vowel choice to stress and sonority, as well as alignment requirements, determine suffix vowel quality for the remainder of forms. Variation is seen to be a function of the relative freqauency with which a particular suffix vowel is designated as aptimal by the different possible rankings of the unranked constraints.},

	Abstract = {This article presents a novel account of the well-known restructuring phenomenon of the Romance languages, concentrating on Italian. I argue that it is possible to retain the benefits of an incorportation analysis while avoiding the associated difficulties by positing that infinitives in fact incorporate with restructuring verbs but that the resulting complex verb cannot be spelled out as such, owing to a constraint banning the realization of more than one morphological word under a single Xo. I show how this analysis accounts for the Italian data discussed in Rizzi 1982 and Burzio 1986, as well as many facts from Old French, Dutch, and English.},

This paper argues against a previous LF approach to the island snensitivity of antecedentless Sluicing, and, showing that htis is just one case of a wider phenomenon, it derives it from the interaction of two independenlty motivated factors: the scope parallelism in ellipsis constructions in general -- implemented in terms of Rooth's Focus Condition --, and the narrow scope of implicit indefinites. These two ingredients derive the following generalization: antecedentless Sluicing is usually ungrammatical when an operator -- no matter whether it constitutes a strong island or not -- intervenes between the sluiced wh phrsae and its trace. It also predicts that, in some particular cases, this type of Sluicing will succeed even when there is or appears to be an intervenor. These cases will follow from the Focus Condition (through implicational bridging) and from the interplay of several pragmatics and discourse factors: E-type pronouns, Modal Subordination, discourse constraints on anaphora and presupposition accomodation.},

	Abstract = {Raising-to-subject (SpecAgrsP) verbs such as seem and so-called ECM or raising -to-object (SpecAgroP) verbs such as believe display a semantic alternation that can be captured in the same way as in Freeze's (1993) and Kayne's (1994) analysis of have and be. With respect to the syntax of the sentential complement of these verbs, it is shown that analyses of raising and ECM in terms of a 'reduced' sentential complement are theoretically and empirically untenable. An analysis of raising is developed which requires two steps: in the embedded CP complement of seem/believe, AgrsP first moves to Spec CP before the subject in the embedded Spec AgrsP moves to the matrix Spec Agrs/oP (seem/believe) position. The first step is motivated as Focus-movement, and allows for an explanation of the relation of seem type verbs to verbs of comparison in many languages. The presence of a [+Focus] C inthe sentential complement of seem/believe also accounts for Focus-related restrictions on the subject of the embedded complement of believe type verbs, which were observed by Postal (1974) for a subset of English ECM verbs (his DOC-verbs) and by Kayne (1981) and Pollock (1985) for French ECM verbs.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines the surface realization of vowel sequences in languages with only monophthongal vowels. The first vowel of an underlying vowel sequence can surface as a glide or be deleted, among other patterns. These distributions are shown to follow from constraint interaction as defined by Prince and Smolensky's (1993) 'Optimality Theory'. Concomitant with these surface distributions is a long vowel that is traditionally analyzed as compensatory lengthening. In 'Optimality Theory', the length of the surface vowel and the distribution of prevocalic vowels are due to best-satisfying syllable well-formedness and input/output Correspondence constraints.
The alternations affecting the first vowel of a sequence illustrate two main tenets of Optimality Theory. One is Parallelism, that is, the output form of a prevocalic vowel is determined by simultaneously comparing moraic and nonmoraic parses of the vowel for constraint satisfaction. The other main tenet explored here is that interlinguistic variation is due to different rankings of the same set of constraints. This is demonstrated by discussing the alternations affecting prevocalic vowels in four Aftrican langauges, Luganda, Etsako, Yoruba, and Kimatuumbi. The nature of constraint interaction in Optimality Theory is shown to account for certain generalizations of prevocalic vowel distribution.},

It is shown here that contextually-dependent weight, as Hayes (1994) calls it, is a consequence of simultaneously comparing monomoraic and bmoraic parses of closed syllables for constraint satsifaction. The weight of closed syllables is a consequence of constraint interaction that determines the moraicity of coda consonants. These constraints are shown to conflict with higher ranking metrical constraints leading to contextually-dependent weight.
Two types of constraint interaction are discussed here (1) closed syllables are light, but contextually heavy to satisfy some higher ranking constraint and (2) closed syllables are heavy, but are contextually light for the same reason. The behavior of closed syllables with respect to the constraint hierarchy is contrasted with the behavior of vowels in the same context. The independent behavior of long vowels and closed syllables is shown here to follow from the different Correspondence constraints (McCarthy and Prince 1995) that determine the weight of vowels and closed syllables.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an account of the semantics of copular be as displayed in its behaviour in the be+AP configurations. I begin by arguing against the Partee/Dowty distinction between a semantically null be of predication and a thematically relevant agentive be, and I propose that there is one semantically relevant verb whose grammatical role is to turn an AP predicate into a verbal one. The denotation of be must thus be a function from denotations of Adjective Phrases to denotation of Verb Phrases. I argue that these denotations are crucially different in kind: verbs (and thus VPs) denote eventualities, which are count entities and which are temporally locatalbe, while adjectives (and thus APs) deonte mass entities, which are states and which are not temporally locatable. Be thus denotes a locating function which maps from the mass to the count domain, and is the analogue of the 'packaging' function in the nominal domain. After a comparison between the mass/count distinction in the verbal and nominal domains, I show how this theory accounts for properties of be in small clause and progressive constructions which have hitherto been explained by positing a so-called agentive be.},

The underlying syntactic uniformity of quesitons with li in the two languages is obscured by a series of prosodic idiosyncracies in one language or the other. In Macedonian, the major prosodic phenomenon affecting the placement of liis the option for certain sequences of words to share a single stress. In Bulgarian, two different prosodic phenomena are relevant: stressing of clitics after the negative element ne and inversion of initial clitics with the following verb. When these factors are controlled for, the syntax of li questions in the two languages is strikingly homogeneous. If no element is focused (i.e., moved to SpecCP), the, in both langauges, the tensed verb head-incorporates into li in C. Additional non-syntactic factos, includig lexical differences between the two languages in the clitic/non-clitic status of certain auxiliaries and differences in the usage of li questions, are also discussed.},

It argues that the relevant condition belongs to scope theory and that weak crossover arises from the way in which scope is determined in syntax. This implies that weak crossover can occur whenever an operator must take scope over a pronoun, even when the pronoun and the operator are not coindexed and the intended interpretation of the pronoun is not as a variable bound by the operator. It also implies that, when an operator is for some reason assigned scope in an exceptional manner and escapes the usual syntactici restrictions on scope assignment, bound variable licensing will be exceptionally allowed as well.},

Kerstens claimed that whether an indefinite NP is [+quantificational] or not (in the sense of Milsark 1974) depends on its absolute position in the structure: it is [+quantificational] iff it is outside VP at S-structure. This hypothesis has more recently been revived and extended to other languages by de Hoop (1992) and Diesing (1992). In this paper, I will attempt to show that htere is insufficient empirical support for this generalization. Although the meaning of a structure containing an indefinite object NP undoubtedly varies with the position of the NP relative to other constituents, it is doubtful whether it can be shown that the semantics of the NP itself depends on its absolute position.},

It is argued here that the alleviation of Principle C violations ("antireconstruction effects"), where it occurs in A'-chains, is due not to deletion of hte lower copy, as in Chomsky 1995, but to vehicle change. The introduction of vehicle change into the theory of A'-chains is independently motivated as essential to capturing a robust adjunct/nonadjunct distinction in the reconstruction of pronoun-as-bound-variable readings that has not been discussed up to now; at the same time it predicts the class of "weakest crossover" environments.},

We argue that reconstruction effects can be derived only if the original movement is purely phonological. There are no undoing operations. We present three distinct arguments, based on an interaction between raising and wh-movement in English, facts from agreement with group terms in British English, and multiple scrambing in Japanese. The arguments imply that the T-model is correct in supposing that the movement that affects both LF and PF must precede movement that affects only PF.},

This hypothesis is in turn derived from assumptions as to how the Logical Form of a reduced conditional relates to the one of its non-reduced version.

The focus is on odd coordinations in which und has a full non-finite verb phrase to its immediate right but only a verb phrase fragment to its immediate left. In the analysis of Heycock and Kroch (1994), wuch 'verbal' odd coordinations arise by asymmetric extraction from a first verb phrase coordinate. It is shown here that this analysis misses a robust empirical generalization: in verbal odd corrdinations, the string preceding und must always form a grammatical sentence in isolation. It is argued that this gneeralization can be derived from the Coordinate Structure Constraint, which bans asymmetric extraction. In the spirit of Wilder (1994), it is furthermore argued that grammatical verbal odd corrdinations derive from coordinations of larger phrases which are reduced by Gapping. It is shown that this leads to a unified analysis of verbal odd coordinations and analogous 'nominal' odd coordinations, in which und appears between a full noun phrase and a noun phrase fragment. Further issues addressed are operator scope and the availability of Left Deletion (Right Node Raising) in odd coordinations.},

This thesis is defended against Larson's (1985) proposal that either may be distant from its disjunction as the result of syntactic movement. It is argued that examples which appear to motivate such a movement are to be reanalyzed as involving silent material at the left periphery of a second disjunct. It is shown in detail that a variety of observations on either/or disjunctions fall out from independently established properties of what Ross (1970) calls Gapping. It will also be concluded that in certain cases, second disjuncts host silent subject pronouns. The results reached here are of relevance for future investigations in the syntax of coordinations and the scope of disjunctions.},

	Abstract = {This paper strives to characterize the relation between accent placement and discourse in terms of independent constraints operating at the interface between syntax and interpretation. The Ginenness Constraint requires un-F-marked constituents to be Given. Key here is our definition of Givenness, which synthesizes insights from the literature on the sematnics of focus with older views on informaiton structure. Avoid F requires peakers to economize on F-marking. A third constraint reqruies a subset of F-markers to dominate accent.
The characteristic prominence patterns of "novelty focus" and "contrastive focus" both arise from a combination of the Givenness Constraint and Avoid F. Patterns of prominence in questions as well as in answers to questions are explained in terms of the constraints, thanks in part to the way in which the Gevenness relation is defined. Head/argument asymmetries noted int eh literature on Focus Projection are placed in the phonology-sytnax interface, independent of discourse conditions. Deaccenting follows when Avoid F is ranked higher than constraint(s) governing head/argument asymmetries.},

It is claimed that the type of sentence which embeds the relative clause affects the binding options inside it. A relative clause formed of a chain that ends in a trace triggers functional/pair-list readings regardless of the type of sentence which embeds the relative clause. On the other hand, a relative clause formed of a chain that ends in a pronoun needs to be embedded in an equative sentence in order to trigger such readings. Theis effect is argued to follow from the constraints which govern resumptive pronouns, one of which being that they require salient discourse antecedents. It is also shown that previous analyses which attempt to derive the pronoun/trace alternation from syntactic principles alone fail to account for the equative/non-equative contrast.},

The data provide arguments for representations in which the internal head remains internal at LF. Furthermore, it is shown that the interpretation of this construction involves E-type anaphora, providing evidence for Hoshi's (1995) suggestion. An explicit mechanism for compositional interpretation is proposed, which also derives a restriction on possible internal heads. This study has the corsslinguistic implication that the constructions called "internally headed relative clauses" in various langautges ndo not form a homogeneous class.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether 'main clause infinitival datives' in russian should be analyzed as oblique or 'quirky' subjects, in contrast to anoher type of subject-like datives in Russian, 'I-nominals'. In particular, it examines a claim to this effect made by Moore and Perlmutter (2000). By comparing the datives in question to Icelandic oblique subjects, above all with respect to agreement, the paper demonstrates that Moore and Perlmutter's arguments are untenable, i.e., their arguments do not distinguish between the two dative types in the way they claim. however, it does not follow that Russian infinitival datives are best analyzed as 'non-subjects'. Rather, it is argued, the interesting question raised by subject-like non-nominatives across languages is not whether they should be classified as subjects by some postulated standards, but what they tell us about the interaction of case and other featuers or properties of language, in particular sentence structure and agreement. The concluding section of the paper presents evidence that russian I-nominals differ from Icelandic quirky subjects in not entering into a 'quirky null-agreement' correlation with the finite complex of the clause. In contrast, it is pointed out, Russian infinitival datives could and probably should be analyzed as sharing this peculiar property with Icelandic 'quirks'.},

	Abstract = {In a group of genetically unrelated and otherwise fully regular head-initial SVO languages a particular modal verb is consistently found to occur in predicate-final position, posing a strong empirical challenge to the Universal Base Hypothesis argued for in Cinque (1999). Detailed investigation indicates that the surface forms are however derived from fully regular underlying strudctures via a process of focus-driven light predicate raising. Cross-linguistic variation in the paradigm then shows that the basic modal structure is currently in different stages of development in the languages investigated. In Canonese in particular, it is aruged that the trigger for VP-raising has now become fully fossilized and no longer reflects its original motivation. The paper concludes that certain movement operations may in general occur without any clearly understandable synchronic trigger. Formally, Chomsky's 'strong cateogrial/EPP features' are suggested to correspond precisely to this type of movement whose original motivation has weakened and become hidden during the course of language change.},

	Abstract = {The study of the temporal structure of events in natural language is of prime importance in linguistics. Though there has been recent progress on formal theories of events, these theories do not address certain syntactic and semantic properties peculiar to langauges such as Hindi. This paper concentrates on properties related to perfectivity. It motivates a small number of semantic features for events and their objects, such as whether an object exists independently of an event, whether it is totally affected by the event, and so on. It then formalizes these features. It also shows how they can be formalized in an algebraic framework and applied in a categorial grammar to derive the properties of verbal and nominal predicates. The result is an integration of descriptive semantics with algebraic theories of objects and events.},

Our findings favor a parametric model of acquisition in which the acquired knowledge is not construction-specific; and they favor analyses in which all the constructions belong to asingly syntactic class. On the basis of our results, we argue that acquisition of the entire class depends on the acuquisition of two parametric properties. One property allows the grammar to generate double object datives, causative/perceptual constructions, put-locatives, and V-NP-Particle constructions. V-Particle-NP constructions and to-datives depend on the combination of the first property with a second property.},

In this paper, I show that such phonological phrasing distinctions are also found in Hokkien but in a more restricted environment. I propose a unified analysis of the phrasing facts in Shanghai and Hokkien. Specifically, I claim that the phonological phrasing rules are sensitive to the feature [definite]. A DP specified for the feature [-definite] is phrased differently from one that is specified for [+definite] or unspecified with respect to the definiteness feature. In adidtion, I claim that phonological phrasing rules cannot see a syntactic projeciton with no phonological content. I propose the following phrasing parameters for Shanghai and Hokkien Chinese.

Unlike in Chomsky's minimalist proposal, though, I will argue that the crucial parameter is not weak/strong morphological features, but rather presence/absence of inflectional morphology for a given functional category on a given word. This account crucially relies on close morphological analysis of inflected words. I will also adopt Kayne's (1994) antisymmetry hypothesis, both becasue it sharply narrows down morphologically-driven word-order predictons, and because it allows a more elegant account of West Germanic word order altenrtions, in the spirit of Zwart (1993b).},

In these grammars, all linguistic variation is lexical: constituent order is determined by lexical functional elements, and structure building operations are universal. Given universal constraints on the category system, these grammars can be identified in the limit from a positive text of derived structures, where these structures contain no fatures except the pronounced, phonetic elements. Identification from pronounced strings alone is shown to be impossible. In the light of this last negative result and related problems, rather than assuming that the learner somehow determines constituent structure from prosodic and semantic cues, an alternative approach to the learning problem is proposed.},

The main thesis is that these readings result from different ways of inserting logical operators at the level of Logical Form. The basic operator considered here is a cumulative mapping from predicates that apply to singularities onto the corresponding predicates that apply to pluralities. Given a theory which allows for free insertion of such operators, it can then be shown that the lexical semantics of the reciprocal expressions each other/one another consists of exactly two components, namely an anaphoric variable and a non-identity statement. Thsi receives further support from the observation that it is exactly these two components that can be focused by only; all that remains to be done is to correctly manipulate these components at the level of LF.},

@article{Stiebels:1999,
	Abstract = {In the literature on the argument structure of nominalizations, one can find mainly two approaches: the first approach (e.b., Grimshaw 1990) assumes that argument inheritance is restricted to event nominals or event-related nominals, whose inherited arguments are obligatorily realized. This view contrasts with the assumption in the second approach that all arguments of the base verb are inherited by the nominal unless they are explicitly bound, but that internal arguments of the noun/nominal are optional (e.g., Bierwisch 1989). The first approach predicates noun-verb asymmetries in argument linking for the class of non-event nominals, while the second approach predicts that the argument linking of nouns/nominals differs from that of verbs in general.
Classical Nahuatl, an Uto-Aztecan language, provides evidence against both approaches: in all classes of nominals (event, agent, instrument, locative, and internal argument nominals), unspecific affixes aturate arguments in the base verbs and the derived nominals, independent of whether an event reading is possible or not. Only under the assumption of obligatory argument inheritance can the distribution of active and inactive stems and the distribution of reflexives be explained for the nominals. I will show that none of hte nominals fall under the notion of 'mixed categories' (such as English gerunds), which are expected to display a verb-like argument linking.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies of the Modern Mandarin aspectual zhe have found that as an imperfective marker it typically signals a stative resultant situation. In various modern Chinese dialects, the cognates of zhe, however, can also mark perfect, perfective, inchoative, and progressive aspects, as well as locative. By examining various uses of zhe's cognates in modern Chinese langauges and in historical texts, this paper finds that the imperfective zhe may arise from its uses as a directive verb in Middle Chinese. Furthermore, the imperfective and perfect aspects in Modern Wu are used interchangeably in situations related to resultative senses. It is further hypothesized that it is this type of sematnic overlapping that provides important links leading to the genesis of the various aspectual meanings of zhe's cognates. The paper concludes the genesis of the various aspectual meanings of zhe's cognates. The paper concludes that there are no clear-cut semantic boundaries among the Chinese apsectual categories.},

The Progressive, the Perfect/Parfait, and duration adverbials introduced by in or for are interpreted as aspectual operators which modify eventuality descriptions. The French past tenses are sensitive to aspect, but they do not change the aspectual class of the eventuality description themselves. Instead, they presuppose that the eventuality description they operate on is of the right aspectual type: the Pass{\'e} Simple and Imparfait are tense operators which locate respectively events and states in the past. Free aspectual transitions may be triggered by coercion in order to satisfy the aspectual requirements on aspectual and temporal operators. The analysis is formulated within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT).},

It is shown that both English and Japanese have short scrambling (i.e., scrambling to VP), whereas only Japanese has longer scrambling as well. On the basis of detailed examination of double complement constructions in the two languages, it is argued that English has a kind of overt object shift that moves an accusative DP within VP rather than to a VP-external position where its Case is to be checked, and that this 'partial' object shift results from short scrambling, analyzed as optional, non-feature-checking movement. It is also shown that the obligatoriness of partial object shift in English can be explained in a principled manner in terms of Attract-F and convergence. This proposal not only has important consequences and implications for certain related theoretical and empirical domains, but also provides significant insights into the nature of scrambling and the theory of parametric variation.},

As evidence for this analysis, it will be demonstrated that sika-nai shows effect of the Subjacency Condition, The Proper Binding Condition, and the Linear Crossing Constraint. These principles interact with scrambling and wh-movement in such a way as to further confirm our analysis.

However, Li (1988) and Paul (1996a, b, 1999) observe some prima facie evidence for gapping Chinese. I argue that the examples illustrated by Li and Paul are not canonical gapping sentences that are created by V-to-T movmeent; instead, I propose that they are empty verb sentences. Furthermore, I argue that Chinese has some gapping sentences that result from ATB movement from V to v (LPD). This paper identifies two types of gpaping natural languages: gapping derived by V-to-T movmeent and gapping derived to V-to-v movement. Consequently, gapping should not be an 'all or nothing' phenomenon. The data from Chinese affirm Johnson' (1994) theory of gapping that gapping occurs in those languages only with verb movement.},

To raising has the effect of coindexing subject positions, thus it only occurs in subject control and riasing contexts correlating exclusively with infinitives in Romance. The idea that clitic climbing involves Io raising with coindexing effects is present in Kayne (1989). In this work we argue that it is To in particular that undergoes raising and support this claim with evidence from Salentino and Serbo-Croation, both of which are languages that lack infinitives but manifest clitic climbing out of finite restructuring contexts inflected for Tense. A number of issues concerning the adjunction site of clitics are also addressed.},

It is demonstrated that adjunction of clitics to Agro is excluded by antisymmetry, leading to results in the spirit of Chomsky (1995), who dispenses with the notion of agreement as a functional head, hence as a potential adjunction site for clitics. Assuming that the Linear Correspondence Axiom does not apply after spell-out, we argue that To serves as a host of clitics when Tense features are weak; as for the remaining contexts, we propose that clitics adjoine to heads that are placeholders, departing from the idea that there is a designated functional head and that clitics adjoin to it in all syntactic environments. We present evidence from Greek dialects which supports theses claims and instantiates the different manner in which clitics combine in clusters. We extend our proposals to explain similar issues pertaining to the clitic system of the Standard Romance languages.},

We decompose the learning problem and present formal results for a central subproblem, deducing the constraint ranking particular to a target language, given structural descriptions of positive examples. The structure imposed on the space of possible grammars by Optimality Theory allows efficient convergence to a correct grammar. We discuss implications for learning from overt data only, as well as other learning issues.

I argue that temporal interpretation across sentences in discourse is subject to the same principles as temporal interpretation within sentences, and that there is thus no need to posit independent principles to account for the discourse behavior of tense. This approach makes possible an anlysis of the temporal adverb then. The semantic dependency that then induces between sentences in discourse is argued to be identical to the depnedency that holds within sentences in temporal adjunct clause constructions. In order to explain how the menaing of then differs depending on its position, I claim that then associates different times in tense structure depending on its syntactic position, resulting in different interpretations. This analysis accounts for interpretive parallels between discourse sequences with then and temporal adjunct clauses, and it predicts the interaction of temporal then with perfect tenses, future readings of present tense, and infinitival clause constructions.},

The third type involves a lexical passive compound verb. Support for this claim comes from investigation of the facts regarding licensing of a post-verbal overt pronominal object, locality effects, the occurrence of the particle suo in the bei-construction, and the intervention of adverbs within the bei-V sequence.

	Abstract = {The constituency and the behavior of the clausal clitics in Serbo-Croation, Macedonian and Bulgarian are analyzed. It is argued that, while in Serbo-Croation the clausal clitics are moved to CP and the cluster is formed in a node that is right-adjoined to C0, in Macedonian and Bulgarian the clitics are base-derived in IP, and the cluster is formed to the immediate left of V. The movement of clitics to CP reflects the propensity of the clitics in Common Slavic to occur in clitic-second or Wackernagel position. Nevertheless, this propensity is overruled to the extent to which the verb forms a local domain with the clitics.
In Macedonian, where the verb does form a local domain with the clitics, the clitic cluster is formed in IP, to the immediately left of the finite verb, so that, when the verb moves, the cluster trails along (piggy-backing). In contrast, in Serbo-Croation, the verb does not form a local domain with the clitics and the clitic cluster is formed in reference to a specified syntactic position (the complementiser, in this case), rather than with reference to a specified syntactic category. In Bulgarian, where the verb and the clitics are weakly tied, the clitic cluster is formed in IP, but there is a discrepancy between syntactic and phonological 'allegiance'.
Since the restriction on multiple adjunction in the specifiers to the left of Co follows from the clustering of the clitics in it, while the clitics cluster in Co if they do not form a local domain with the finite verb of their cluase, we may conclude that the Wackernagel Effect indirectly depends on whether or not the clitics form a local domain with that verb. The discrepancy between the syntactic and phonological behavior of the Bulgarian clitics can be explained by the fact that the propensity of the Bulgarian finite verb to form a local domain with the clitics s still weak, so that, while their syntactic properties have changed, the phonological properties of the Bulgarian clitics reflect those of their common Slavic ancestor.},

	Abstract = {The paper focuses on the interaction bewteen clitics and the negation operator, and on how this interaction affects stress in different dialects of Macedonian. The basic claims are, first, that there is no free variation in the relationship of hte clitics and the negation operator; the variation is, instead, only across dialects; and, second, that the phonological relationship of hte clitics to the negation operator depends on teh strength of Neg and on the values for the verbal, [+/-V], and the nominal, [+/-N], features of the head of the clause. In the dialect in which Neg is strong, the clitics encliticize to it. In the dialect with a weak Neg we have two distinct strategies. In clauses in which V is instantiated by a [+V, -N] category, the negation operator merges and forms a single phonological word with V and any modal, auxiliary, or pronomoinal clitics that find themselves wedged between Neg and V. IN clauses in which V is instantiated by a [+V, +N] cateogry, however, the negation operator merges and forms a single phonolgoical word only with the clitics, to the exclusion of the instantiation of V. Since the clitics in clauses with [+V, -N] heads are typically verbal, while the clitics in cluases with [+V, +N] heads gravitate towards a second position, the analysis has an important theoretical ramification: it contributes to determing the relationship between second position and verbal clitic placement.},

In particular, I show that an array of puzzling facts involving potential clitic hosts in a Northern Italian dialect can be understood once we adopt the view that object clitics must be taken to independently occupy distinct functional heads (in spite of phonological indications to the contrary). To show this, I establish that certain adverbs in this language occupy fixed positions within the clause. Once these positions are identified, I use them as probes to understand the position of the clitic. This paper also explores an independent consequence of this explanation of clitic placement: the position of argument prepositions with respect to the fixed object clitic indicates that there is an 'Aspectual Phrase' in the clauses's functional structure. I show that argument prepositions move from their base positions within VP to a functional projection which encodes the semantics of telicity, in contrast with non-argument prepositions (location adverbials), which do not exhibit such movement.},

	Abstract = {This paper offers an analysis of extraction and pied-piping in Tzotzil, a Mayan language, within the framework of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). In this language, pied-piping is accompanied by the obligatory reordering of elements with the piedin the pied-piped XP. This reordering is most evident in constituent questions wehre WH-pied-pipers always occur first in teh string and other elements follow in their normal, canonical order. Within CCG, these facts are accounted for by analyzing pied-pipers as rightward-looking functors from unsaturated NP or PP to functors over verbs or other predicates. By virtue of the lexically specified directionality of these functors and by virtue of a requirement in CCG that all combinatory rules respect this directionality when sanctioning combinations of functors with their arguments, the facts regarding the order of expressions in pied-piped phrases in Tzotzil fall out. No appeal to 'abstract agreement' or any other sort of phrase-structural relation is necessary. The paper demonstrates that the order of elements observed in pied-piped constituents in Tzotzil is an automatic consequence of the syntactic projection of lexical funciton/argument relations by means of the CCG rules of Functional Application and Functional Composition.},

We argue that, under Economy considerations, Merger has priority over Chain Formation in building A'-dependencies. A cross-linguistic correlation between wh-questions and quantification is furtehr established to show that operator-variable dependencies should be parametrized relative to operator height, namely, operartos merging into CP/IP in Chinese, into PP/DP in Japanese, and into Do/No in English. It is further argued that only nouns may enter into unselective binding since they are the sole providers of non-pronominal variables. Adverbs, in contrast, are intrinsic operators and must move to create variables (i.e., traces left behind by movement). Together with the working hypothesis that operator features are not universally strong, the noun-adverb distinction providews a straightfowrad account of LF argument-adjunct asymmetries, reinventing the insights of Huang (1982) and Lasnik and Saito (1984, 1992) in a minimalist fashion.},

In the former type, verbs move to a higher functional head, either overtly or covertly, and non-specific numeral indefinites may appear in [Spec, TP] at s-structure. This is the case with English, where cardinal subjects are commonplace. In the latter type, verbs do not move to a higher functional head, and non-specific numeral indefinites cannot appear in [Spec, TP] at s-structure. This is the case with Chinese, where cardinal subjects are relatively rare. Developing the idea that syntax-semantics mappin is cyclic and closely aligned with syntacic predication, we provide a principled account of an asymmetry between Chinese declarative and modal constructions with respect to their subject specificity.},

	Abstract = {In Japanese, the high vowels [i, u] become devoiced when they occur between voiceless segments, e.g., [kitai] 'expectation'. When a word contains a sequence of devoiceable syllables, however, not all high vowels are devoiced, and some are necessarily voiced: [kisitsu] 'termperament', [sekisitsu] 'room made of rock'. These words contain two consecutive devoiceable vowels, but only one of them, either the first or the second vowel in the sequence, is devoiced. Previous studies have claimed that it is impossible to predict which vowels are to be devoiced in consecutive devoiceable syllables. In this paper, I argue that devoicing sites are predictable when we understand the conflicting factors at work. Crucially, I argue that devoiced vowels are specified for the features [+spread glottis], departing from the traditional phonological analysis of Japanese vowel devoicing (e.g., McCawley (1968)), which considers devoicing as an assimilation of the feature [-voice]. I further propose several constraints on the sitribution of the feature [+s.g.]. I show that the locus of devoicing in consecutive devoicing environments is determined by the interaticon of these constraints. The analysis is couched in Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky (1993)).},

In this paper we first claim that kake mominalization should recognize the two meanings, the "halfway" reading adn the inception reading, for its accurate description. Based on the observation that the "halfway" rading occurs with (transitive) accomplishment verbs while the inception rading is possible with any verb, we further claim that telicity is a key notion to account for the "halfway" reading. Moreover, we argue that the "halfway" interpretation requires that an event extend over an interval so that a halfway point of the even can be measured. Achievement verbs, although telic, denote a punctual event, and therefore the nominal cannot receive the "halfway" reading: it can only have the inception reading. We also demostrate that telicity can be invoked by contextual information. Our analysis overcomes the problems that Kishimoto' smacrorole-based analysis faces and yet subsumes its generalization: the lowest ranking nonagent macrorole argument generally serves as the dewlimiter of the action denoted by the verb.},

	Abstract = {In Albanian a K-word can be used as an interrogative, as a polarity item (PI) and, in combination with certain particles, as a qauantifier. I proose an analysis of these elements as avariables in the snese of Heim (1982). In order to receive an interrogative reading, a K-word must obligatorily move to a Focus phrase projection. Overt movement is due to the presence of a (strong) Focus feature on the K-word. In the absence of such a feature, a K-word remains in situ and can only be interpreted as a PI. The set of possible binders that licnese PI includes the negation, question operators, conditional complementizers, modal verbs and modal particles. The properties of PIs are satisfied by covert dependency formation. This dependency does not involve abstract movement but rather a binding relation. More precisely, polarity itmes and their operators form a head-to-head dependency sensitive to strong and weak islands.},

In this paper, I will take a closer look at DSCs in Japanese and Korean, and then, under the assumptions of the minimalist framework, I will try to give a consistent account, with the aid of the Agr-less checking theory, of their syntactic peculiarities.},

@article{Uriagereka:1999,
	Abstract = {This article discusses a long-known restriction on Wh-movement in Basque, describing it in terms of barriers. In essence, Wh-movement is impossible across a morphologically-expressed specifier, while it is possible across a corresponding null pronominal. It is argued that this restriction holds more generally for any category that licenses null arguments in pro-drop languages. The paper then accounts for the descriptive restriction in Minimalist terms, deriving barrier requirements from independently required derivational dynamics. In particular, an attracted feature F, related to a functional projection K containing 'heavy' agreement, forces an ancillary morphological repair to apply to the category alpha which F comes from. This morphological repair results in K being spelled-out and consequently frozen (as a sort of compound) for further syntactic computation; islands (or barriers) emerge as a consequence of the Spell-out of K. An account is also provided for why A-movement is possible across a morphologically-expressed specifier (in contrast to A'-movement). Apart from having consequences for the proper statement of various mechanisms assumed within the Minimalist Program, the analysis constitutes strong evidence for this system in its radically derivational variant (with Spell-out applying repeatedly when convergence demands it), inasmuch as it provides a natural way to understand barriers as a dynamic property of derivational syntax.},

In addition to the null subject pattern, Finnish and Hebrew differe both from traditional pro-drop and from nonpro-drop languages in the patterning of the agreement paradigm; the analysis developed here provides a connection between the mixed null subject pattern and the special agreement paradigm.},

	Abstract = {In this article some empirical arguments for maintaining the basic notion of structural symmetry in coordination (williams 1977, 1978, 1981) are presented. It is argued that a symmetric approach is actually better able to address the matter of derivational economy in a minimalist sense. Though coordination can be asymmetric, this occurs in a less than optimal derivation, for instance when coordination as a structural and semantic principle breaks down for some reason. In that case asymmetry is the default when coordination fails, and the phrase structure remains simplex. In most coordinate constructions, it is argued, symmetric coordiantion is maintained as a structural principle, and as such it forms a unified whole with the semantics of coordination, which is always symmetric.
In the approach to coordinate structure presented here, conjuncts are right-adjoined at lexical insertion, i.e. they do not occur in derived postiions such as Specifier positions. A conjunct is a projection of its own head category, and this projection is right-adjoined without the generation of a maximal projection of hte conjucntion (there is no \&P). In right adjunction all conjuncts are hierarchically equal, though linear precedence produces certain binding asymmetries. A coordinating conjunction, when it occurs, is left-adjoined to the last conjunct. Features percolate freely between matching (symmetric) conjuncts and form the basis of various types of agreement and ellipses. In the case of clausal conjuncts, one clause must complete lexical insertion and overt movement before another conjunct can be generated. Empirical evidence is presented from subject-verb, verb-object and pronoun-antecedent agreement, gapping, ATB and parasitic gap constructions, mismatched conjuncts and "asymmetric" cases of coordination.},

	Abstract = {Many Altaic languges restrict round vowel distribution. This paper examines round harmony in Classical Manchu and Oroquen, where round spreading occurs only when the first two syllables of a word are round, that is, it requires a bisyllabic trigger (Zhang 1996). It is argued that the binary threshold emerges from conflict betwen well-established phonological demands -- numeric reference is neither necessary nor desirable. The study isloates two distinct restrictions on rounding in bisyllabic trigger languges: initial round licensing and round spreading -- requirements occurring independently in Classical Mongolian and Ulcha. Separating these restctions is key: each is active in conflicting constraint that restricts features to a tautosyllabic domain. Ranking the tautosyllabic constraint between round licensing and spreading prevents cross-syllable spreading except when violations of tautosyllabicity are independently necessitated by round licensing. As a result, spreading is initiated only when the first two syllables are round. Implications are identified for the characterization of faithfulness. Positional faithfulness constraints play a key role in realizing the privileged status of the root-initial syllable in round licenisng and harmony. In addition, the analysis supports the sparation of Ident(F) into IO and OI constraints, which distinguish between the loss and gain of privative features specifications, respectively. the distinction proves essential in the case of bisyllabic triggers. The constraint interaction that produces the two-syllable trigger threshold is instance of a general phenomenon explored here, termed Parasitic Constraint Satisfaction. This kind of interaction arises when there are two constraints or constraint sets, a and b, whose satisfaction each necessitates violating a constraint, g, and they are ranked a>>g>>b. When satisfaction of a compels violations of g that also permit satisfaction of b, then b is described as parasitic on a. Two outcomes for Parasitic Constraint Satisfaction are discussed. The first is an emergence of the unmarked, occurring when b is a markedness constraint whose activity emerges in contexts where it is parasitic on a. The second outcome, where b is a faithfulness constraint, si an emergence of the faithful.},

	Abstract = {A comparative analysis of English and Japanese shows that the set of permissible resultatives in Japanese is properly contained in the set of permissible resultatives in English. Although English resultatives naturally divide into transitive and intransitive resultatives (in the sense of Carrier and Randall (1992)), and intransitive resultatives are systematically missing from Japanese, it is not exactly this distinction that demarcates the English set and teh Japanese set since Japanese permits only certain types of transitive resultatives, rejecting other types that would be possible in English. Languages like French are essentially like Japanese in this respect. Thus, the category "transitive resultatives" needs to be divided into at least two types (called here WEAK and STRONG resultatives), and there is a natural class of resultatives comprising strong transitive resultatives and all intransitive resultatives, the latter being always "strong" by the definition of this notion given in this paper. Certain examples that bear a superficial resemblance to resultatives (called here SPURIOUS resultatives) are also discussed and shown to constitute a different phenomenon. Finally, the weak/strong distinction is given a specific theoretical interpretation in terms of the notion "patienthood." The relevance of this interpretation to the Subset Principle is briefly discussed.},

In a dialect of Yemeni Arabic, emphasis has two articulatory correlates, pharyngealization and labialization: within the phonological word, pharyngealization spreads predominantly leftward, and labialization spreads rightward, targeting short high vowels. Since asymmetries in the directionality of spread of a secondary feature are phonetically motivated and depend on whether the feature is anchored to the onset or the release phase of the primary articulation, it is arged that the unmarked directionality of spread should be encoded in the phonology as a markedness statement on that feature.},

We further assume that passive, causative, and applicative are morpholexical operations on argument structure. This set of assumptions allows us to explain (i) why conditions on Balinese binding are generally 'thematic' adn independent of 'surface' grammatical relations or phrase structure position; and (ii) the specific exceptions to such thematic conditons that arise with raised arguments, direct/oblique alternations, and passive by-phrases.},

	Abstract = {Nasality is one of the most characteristic aspects of the Portuguese vowel system. The literature on the subject of nasality distinguishes between nasal vowels, nasalized vowels, and nasal diphthongs. In agreement with earlier proposals it is argued that nasal vowels derive synchronically from underlying sequences of a vowel followed by a nasal mora. The discussion of nasalized vowels concentrates on the behavior of the palatal nasal /n/. Allophonic nasalization caused by /n/ seems to function in a way comparable with (surface) constrastive nasalization triggered by the nasal mora. This effect is explained as a consequence of the fact that palatal sonarants are represented as phonological geminates. The phonology of nasal diphthongs will also be discussed, and it will be shown that they are not derived from an oral diphthong followed by a nasal mora, as is generally assumed, but are represented as nasal diphthongs at the level of lexical representation.},

@article{Wiklund:2001,
	Abstract = {In the context of a subclass of bare complements in Swedish, the present paper argues for a structure of grammar that partly separates the mechanisms that build syntactico-semantic structures from those determining the phonological expression of these. The parasitic supine construction displays the properties that are relevant for such separation: a clear-cut discrepancy between form and meaning. The construction type exemplifies a complementation strategy available for a restricted class of infinitive selecting verbs in variants of the Scandinavian languages. The complement verb surfaces with an inflection identical to that of the matrix verb, yet the form has no effect on the interpretation, which remains the same as for the infinitival counterpart used in the standard language. The approach makes use of grammatical feature underspecification, the seeming gap between meaning and form being bridged by selectional restrictions and constraints on the relevant syntactic configuration. On the basis of its distribution, it is proposed that the phenomenon is a restructuring effect. The form is the result of morphological manipulations of the underspecified syntactico-semantic structure, providing it with the necessary clothes for Vocabulary Insertion.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses two related problems. The major empirical problem concerns the difference betseen two pronominal forms found in German: personal pronouns and so-called d-pronouns, which are also used as relative pronouns. The major theoretical question concerns the nature of relative pronouns in general. I will argue that d-pronouns are definite determiners, i.e., full Determiner Phrases (DPs) containing an empty NP whereas personal pronouns are merely the spell out of phi features (AgrD) not containing an NP-projection. This will allow us to account for the distributional differences between the two forms. In addiiton, I will argue for a restriction on Operator-variable chains that will derive the fact that only d-words but not personal pronouns can be used as relative pronouns in a language that makes use of the a'-movement strategy for relativization. It will also follows that relativization without A'-movement is possible with either a personal pronoun or a gap occupying the relativized position.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the syntax of independent pronouns in Halkomelem Salish and argues that these pronouns are morphosyntactically complex. In particular, the paper shows that independent pronouns contain a syntactically active determiner, and concludes that they are full DPs with an elliptical NP. Licensing of elliptical NPs is subject to cross-linguistic variation, and thus not all languages allow for determiners to be used pronominally. The analysis of independent pronouns as full DPs is supported by their external syntax as well as their binding properties. It is shown that independent pronouns behave like R-expressions in that they are subject to Condition C. On the basis of this observation, it is concluded that binding theory must be sensitive to syntactic categories, and, crucially, that regular 'condition B' pronouns cannot be analyzed as (intransitive) DPs, contrary to standard assumptions.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the issue of symmetric and nonsymmetric focus and deaccentuation in VP ellipsis (VPE). In contrast to most previous approaches to the information structure of VPE (Rooth 1992b, Tomioka 1995, Fox 1998), which claim under a symmetry assumption that the function of VPE is to contrastively focus the remaining subject in relation to the subject in the antecedent clause, I show that in the unmarked case, focus and deaccentuation in the antecedent and the elliptical clause need not be symmetric. I propose a unified account of the informaiton structure of VPE by assuming a single PF economy priniciple, Silent Copy, interacting with a syntactic focus theory which allows for layered focus structures. In particular, Silent Copy favors to leave a syntactic copy unpronounced provided focus is assigned to the head of the sentence internal polarity phrase. The arguements in support of this proposal rest to a substantial degree on a theory of focus in question-answer contexts, as proposed by Drubig (1998). I show that VPE characterized by nonsymmetric focus and deaccentuation occurs as an answer to multiple wh-question giving rise to a presentational focus reading. The symmetric focus and deaccentuation type then falls out as a special case in which the VPE answers a narrowly focusing question.},

Yet in this paper it is argued that the simpler treatment of distributivity using unary universal quantification should be retained. Seemingly polyadic effects are claimed to be restricted to definite NPs. This fact is accounted for by the special anaphoric (dependent) use of definites. Further evidence concerning various plurals, island constraints and cumulative quantification is shown to support this claim. In addition, it is shown that the evidence against a simple atomic version of unary distributivity is not decisive either. In the (uncommon) cases where distributivity which definites is not strictly atomic, they can be analyzed as dependent implicit quantifiers.},

It argues that the traditional typology of distributive and collective predicates is unsuitable for a truth-conditional theory of plurality. A new test is proposed for classifying the semantic number of predicates according to their behavior with singular/plural quantificational noun phrases such as every/all student(s) and no teache(s). Predicates that are (in)sensitive to such number variations are called atom/set predicates, respectively, and it is shown that this distinction cuts across the traditional distributive/collective typology. The processes that govern the semantic number of sentences are reanalyzed in these terms.},

First, ergative is not a structural Case like nominative or accusative; instead, ergative is a lexical Case like the dative. Second, contrary to the usual assumption that UG allows for only one structural Case for objects, there are, in fact, two structural object Cases available in UG: on, termed 'objective Case' here, is assigned/checked in Spec Agr-O and is associated with object agreement, if the langauge has object agreement. There is a limit of one objective Case per clause. The other, termed 'accusative Case' here, is assigned/checked by V inside VP and is never associated with object agreement. There may be more than one structural accusative Case per clause. The third claim is that the following descriptive generalization holds universally: in a clause with a lexically Cased subject (e.g., ergative or dative) the highest object cannot have structural accusative Case (although that object can have objective Case). That generalization and the facts that motivated Burzio's (1986) generalization are manifestations of a broader generalization governing the maximum number of accusative Cases that a verb can assign.},

	Abstract = {It is potentially undesirable consequence of Chomsky's Bare Phrase Structure framework that ergative and unergative verbs would share the same argument structure. The present paper proposes to address this problem by arguing that all verbs are potentially transitive. An analysis of the structure of complex verb forms (Dutch and German past participles containing an aspectual prefix ge- and a tense suffix -t) in terms of Kayne's Linear Correspondence Axiom (LCA) suggests that the prefix occurs in the complement of the verbal root, thus in effect making unergatives transitive. The structure porposed for the participle furthermore allows one to explain two familiar restrictions on verb raising, the first being its incompatibility with particle verbs, the second the so-called INFINITUS PRO PARTICIPIO (IPP) effect. It is argued that IPP involves the deletion of an inflectional prefix, required to bring the structure of a verbal cluster in agreement with LCA. A particular case of this phenomenon in certain Flemish dialects is discussed, where the prefix gets deleted but the suffix remains unaltered. This variety of IPP supports the hypothesis that the prefix is responsible for the IPP effect.},

	Abstract = {An optimality-theoretic analysis of third tone sandhi (TS) domains of Mandarin in proposed in preference to other approaches. The constraint-based analysis provides a descriptively better solution to questions such as why it is possible for a preposition to resist tone sandhi in certain structures, a long-standing problem in tone sandhi studies. The paper shows that this resistance to tone sandhi is dependent on both syntactic structures and syntactic categories. In this study, Madnarin tone sandhi domains are related to constituent strength represenations, which are direct mappings of syntactic structures. An unspecified order of strong/weak values of constituent strength for a prepositional phrase is proposed. To define a TS domain, several constraints related to metrical factors, constituent strength, the tone sandhi domain grouping direction, and output condition are shown to interact with each other. The optimal tone sandhi domain represenation is always the one which violates the lowest-ranked constraints and violates any single constraint to the least degree possible, compared to other rrepresentations. The avoidance of tone sandhi by an element, whether it is a preposition or anohter category, is the result of interactions of the constraints. The variability of surface tone patterns comes from more than one optimal output, from speaking rate or style, and from two possible kinds of competition due to the unspecified constitutent strength.},

On the one hand, there is an NP raising in copula constructions, and the raising is optional if an overt copula shows up, and obligatory if there is no overt copula. On the other hand, there is also nominal raising to the left of a repetitive or durative expression, and the raising is optional if an overt verb shows up, and obligatory if there is no overt verb. Second, the occurrence of a null verb is restricted by the specificity feature of the object. Specifically, if the object is indefinite, the selecting verb cannot be null. This is shown in both simplex predicate constructions and constructions with secondary predicates.},

It is suggested that the effect arises because disjunctions are conjunctive lists of epistemic possibilities. Consequently, if the modal may is itself epistemic, (1) comes out as equivalent to (2), due to general laws of epistemic logic. On the other hand, on a deontic reading of may, (2) is only implied under exceptional circumstances -- which usually obtain when (1) is used performatively.},

Our study leads us to discard an all-syntactic account of the special position of clitics, of the sort developed by Ouhalla and Boukhris for Berber, and by Njie (1982) an Dunigan (1994) for Wolof, and to adopt an approach crucially separating the syntactic and morphophonological properties of clitics, along the lines set by various scholars wrking on the syntax-phonology interface.},

Malagasy personal pronouns surface either as independent words or as suffixes, two sets of forms which some properties identify as strong and weak, in C\&S's framework. Further investigation, however, reveals that C\&S's strong/weak distinction, framed in terms of the hierarchical projection of functional categories, only partially captures the properties of Malagasy pronouns. What the Malagasy data suggest is that degrees of deficiency involve different components of linguistic theory. We argue that morphological deficiency, caused by suffixation, is independent from both phonological deficiency (caused by the lack of word-stress) and from syntactic deficiency (caused by the lack of some syntactic projection). Evidence from Malagasy further leads us to conclude, contra C\&S, that syntactic deficiency does not necessarily arise from peeling off the topmost projection in a tree structure.},

Vowel harmony is argued to be featurally represented, but acoustic evidence shows that vowel assimilation is gradient and best represented in terms of articulatory gestures. Neither representation is adequate in itself to describe the full range of phonological and phonetic data: rather, I advocate a mapping procedure that takes advantage of the resemblances between autosegmental and gestural representations without collapsing the two. A complete account of Igbo vowel harmony and assimilation is provided, demonstrating the need for two kinds of representation, and illustrating the suggested feature-to-gesture mapping.},

	Abstract = {I discuss two competing theories of the progressive: the theory proposed in Parsons (1980, 1985, 1989, 1990) and the theory proposed in Landman (1992). These theories differ in more than one way. Landman regards the progressive as an intensional operator, whicl Parsons doesn't. Moreover, Landman and Parsons disagree on what uninflected predicates denote. For Landman, cross the street has in its denotation complete events of crossing the street; the aspectual contribution of English simple past (perfective aspect) is the identity function. For Parsons, both complete and incomplete eents of crossing the street can be in the denotation of the base VP; perfective aspect restricts its denotation to the events that culminate. I present a version of Parson's theory that avoids the problems raised by Landman, in particular the problem posed for Parsons by creation verbs. The reparied version and Landman's theory still differ in the way they analyze uninflected predicates. I present evidence form Slavic languages that both etheories are needed. Finally, I discuss some evidence that may favor one or the other approach to the semantics of the English progressive.},

	Abstract = {I argue in this paper for a novel analysis of case in Icelandic, with implications for case theory in general. I argue that structual case is the manifestation on the noun phrase of features which are semantically interpretable on verbal projections. Thus, Icelandic case does not encode features of noun phrase interpretation, but it is not uninterpretable either; case is properly seen as reflecting (interpretable) tense, aspect, or Aktionsart features. Accusative case in Icelandic is available when the two subevents introduced in a transitive verb phrase are temporally identified with each other, and dative case is available when the two parts are distinct. This analysis bears directly on the theory of reature checking in teh Minimalist Program. specifically, it is consistent with a restrictive theory of feature checking in which no features are strictly uninterpretable: all formal features come in interpretable-uninterpretable pairs, and feature checking is the matching of such paires, driven by legibility conditions at Spell-Out.},

	Abstract = {It is a well-known fact that most of the Germanic languages can use modal verbs iwth non-verbal complements. In the present paper I will focus on modals with directional PPs such as the German \emph{Ich muss nach hause}. There are two ways to analyze such constructions. Either we say that the modal can (also) be used as a main verb, in which case it can have a complete theta-structure, a full-blown subcategorization frame (e.g., Barbiers (1995), or we can say that, among the verbal complements the modal verb can combine with, thereis a super-light motion verb [e]GO. Swiss German presents us with the two incontrovertible arguments to the effect that there has to be an empty GO. Teh first, due to J. Hoekstra (1997), is based on the distributionj of PPs in verbal clusters. A second argument comes from Verb Doublling. Dutch and German differ from Swiss German in this prespect. It is tempting to assume that these languages lack the empty GO. However, West Flemish confronts us with a paradox: according to one argument it must have empty GO, accoridng to the other it must lack it. The only way in which the paradox can be resolved, it is argued, is to assume that all varieties (there are relevant additional data from Afrikaans, Alsatian, German, Frisian, and Luxemburgish) have the phonetically empty super-light motion verb GO but that the variation is due to a 'Pure Parameter'. This parameter, the Projection Parameter, is argued to regulate the licensing of empty light motion verbs as well as the occurrence of Verb (Projection) Raising.},

However, while \emph{ha} can only be left out after modal verbs in Norwegian, \emph{ha}-omission has a wider distribution in Swedish. This indicates that the optionality of \emph{ha} depends on more than one factor. In constructions with modal verbs, hte head that is spelled out as \emph{ha} can be present or absent in both languages. That is, the optionality of \emph{ha} is connected to the optionality of generating the relevant head. In Swedish, there is the additional possibility of generating \emph{ha} without spelling it out. More precisely, \emph{ha} need not be spelled out if \emph{ha }shares its features with some element that is overtly realized. Still, ther eis much variation between speakers of Swedish concerning the distribution of optional \emph{ha}. It appears that a number of grammatical features contribute to the optionality of a phonologically realized \emph{ha}.},

Dependent ellipsis is the process by which a coordinate null head licenses the heads of its direct dependents to be null as well. We show that,  under the hypothesis that dependent ellipsis is not a trnasitive relation, the properties of determiner sharing constructions follow, adding some new observations to those noted before in the literature. For example, we explain that subject determiner sharing is usually only possible if Tense is gapped in the second conjunct while object determiner sharing is dependent on Verb-gapping. however, we also show that in certain cases subject D-sharing may be possible without T-gapping, and, vice versa, there are cases where T-gapping does not license subject D-sharing.},

	Abstract = {According to a variety of tests, 'What John likes is himself" displays the same c-command relations as "John likes himself." But note of these relations appears to hold on the surface; this is the 'connectivity problem'. Revisionists maintain that the problematic examples are identity sentences with no hidden structure, but that none of our c-command tests is infallible. Conservatives claim that our c-command tests are reliable, but that the clause "John likes himself" is indeed present at some level of representation. Siding with the conservatives, we follow Ross's (1972) original insight and suggest that connectivity sentences equate a concealed question with an elided answer: "[What John likes] = [\sout{John likes} himself]." new arguments are given for each component of the analysis, and it is shown that connectivity effects are obviated when the elements that are equated are referential rather than clausal. The correct truth-conditions are derived from the semantics of identity, together with Groenendijk and Stokhof's (1990) semantics for questions. The analysis is then extended to cases of DP connectivity, such as "his ory is himself," by usggesting that semantically dyadic nouns have an additional argument position, yielding the representation: "[?x his [worry x]] = [ \sout{his [ worry} himself]]." finally, it is shown that recent objections based on 'anti-connectivity' effects misfire, because the same facs hold of question-answer pairs, as expected on the present approach.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that certain Slavic reflexive clitics should be analyzed as indefinite defective pronouns in both syntax and semantics, and we go on to identify syntactic and semantic parametric variation among refelxicve clitics in Slavic. Reflexive clitics that correspond to "people" represent nominative indefinite pronouns in Polish and Slovenian, and accusative indefinite pronouns in all the Slavic langauges, so there is syntactic variation among such indefinties. In syntax, indefinite clitics stand for explicit arguments that are defective because they contain a hman feature and no gender, number, or person and move to repair deficiency. In sematnics, they contain human variables and quantifiers reminiscent of "some," which can be deleted by existential disclosure. When quantifiers are deleted and adverbs bind indefintie clitics, such clitics may resemble "everyone," "many people," and "few people." In constructions with datives, Slavic clitics display a complex web of semantic and syntactic variation due to dative existential disclosure in logical form. Dative existential disclosure combines quantifier deletion with one of two operations binding datives to disclosed variables. In Polish and Slovenian, constructions with indefinite clitics and datives have the same syntax but differ in truth conditions because quantifiers are delted, and datives bind disclosed variables in one way in Polish and another way in Slovenian. In Czech and Bulgarian, dateive existential disclosure affects refelxive clitics standing for implicit arguemtns with different syntactic properties. Thus, there is syntactic variation, with Polish and Slovenian forming one sytnactic group and Bulgarian and Czech another. Variation extends to semantics, because the meaning of constructions with reflexive clitics and datives is the same in Bulgarian and slovenian, while Czech belongs to the same semantic group as Polish.},

	Abstract = {There is a well-known rule of Russian whereby /i/ is said to be realized as [i] after non-palatalized consonants. Somewhat less well known is another allpphonic rule of Russian whereby only [i], and not [-i], can follow velars within a morphological word. This latter rule came about due to a sound change in East Slavic called post-vlar fronting here: k-i > kji (and similarly for the other velars). This paper examines this sound change in depth, and argues that it can be adequately explained only by appeal to the funcitonal notions of perceptual distinctiveness of contrast and neutralization avoidance. Further, these notions crucially require a systemic approach to phonology, in which the wellformedness of any form must be evaluated with reference to the larger system of contrasts it enters into. These notions are formalized in a modified version of Dispersion Theory (Flemming 1995a), a systemic theory that incorporates these functional notions into Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993).},

A close examination of wh-extraction out of object NPs reveals that previously unnoticed semantic factors play a greater role than has been recognized. In particular, we find that NPs lakcing 'participant' structure do not permit wh-extraction at all, and that certain NPs permit extraction even when they are definite. At the same time, the prohibition on wh-extraction from subject NPs is shown to be a purely syntactic phenomenon which arises from teh particular way in which the Extended Projection Principle is satisfied in English.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes that the meanings of some natural language expressions should be thought of as functions on their own continuations. Continuations are a well-established analytic tool int eh theory of programming language semantics; in brief, a continuation is the entire default future of a computation. I show how a continuation-based grammar can unify several aspects of natural language quantification in a new way: merely stating the truth conditions for quantificational expressions in terms of continuations automatically accounts for scope displacement and scope ambiguity. To prove this claim, I exhibit a simple finite context-free grammar with a strictly compositional semantics in which quantificational NPs are interpeted in situ but take semantic scope over larger constituents. There is not Quantifier Raising (nor any use of a lvel of Logical Form distinct from overt syntax), no Cooper Storage (re similar mechanisms used in many recnt HPSG, Categorial, or type-logical treatments), and no need for type shifting (as in Hendriks' Flexible Types account). continuations also provide a natural account of generalized coordination that does not require either type-shifting or type polymorphism. Compositionality issues are discussed in some detail.},

	Abstract = {The "rationale clause infinitive" is a modifier of the verb which expresses an agent's intention in acting as they do. The rationale clause is related to the matrix in two important ways: the null subject ofthe inifintive (PRO) is usually coreferential iwth a phrase in teh matrix (control), and the intention it expresses is ususally assigned to a phrase in teh matrix (predication). Given the controller and argument of the rationale clause are usually clausemates of the infinitive itself, the strongest hypothesis is that both control and predication are strictly local. however, there has been much debate in teh literature concerning the viability of such a locality constraint. In this article, I argue in favou of a locality-based account of control and predication in the rationale clause, comparing it with a discourse-semantic constraint approach and a logophoricity constraint approach. Data from two related modifier infinitives (the "purpose clause" and the "telic clause") will be used to sharpen the discussion.},

This paper argues agaist this view based on an anlysis of specificational pseudoclefts in Hebrew. Pseudoclefts in Hebrew are interesting in two ways. First predicational and specificational pseudoclefts are distinguished lexically in the choice of the copula. Second specificational pseudoclefts fall into two classes, each exhibitin a different set of connectivity effects. The connectivity pattern in Hebrew is accounted for following Jacobson (1994) and Sharvit (1999), who assume that connectivity effects are independent of each other and derive them as a by-product of semantic equation. It is shown that this pattern cannot be obtained using any single grammatical operation, such as reconstruction or copying, which would necessarily derive all connectivity effects at once.},

The Armenian facts futhermore indicate that attempts to abandon underlying representations (Flemming 1995, Burzio 1996) are misguided and that we must also retreat from the excessively abstract underspecification approaches advocated by most phonologists.},

As opposed to its rivals, this analysis derives the following characteristics: (i) Resulatative and verb jointly express a single event involving direct causation. (ii) Resultatives form a constituent with the verb. (iii) the head of a resultative complex predicate cannot itself be complex, but the nonhead can. (iv) all thematic information int he head can contribute to the theta-grid of a complex predicate; the nonhead can only contribute the thematic information associated with its external theta-role. (v) The head of a resultative complex predicate expresses an event while the nonhead expresses a resulting state or interrelation. (vi) Resultatives are object-oriented. (vii) Depending ont he thematic properties of the head, the objedct (or derived subject) of a resultative complex predicate must, can, or cannot be interpreted as the internal argument of the verb. (viii) A resultative complex predicate cannot head a doublect object construction.

	Abstract = {The dative alternation poses a learnability paradox: when children hear \emph{give money to him} and \emph{give him money}, they could formulate a rule deriving the double object from the prepositional form, but they rule would allow overgeneralization from \emph{done money to him} to \emph{*donate him money}. Children are not corrected for speaking ungrammatically, so how do they avoid overgeneralizing? The 'conservatism'' hypothesis proposes that children do not generalize at all; the 'criteria' hypothesis holds that children learn to constrain their rule to apply to monosyllabic verbs denoting possession changes. In a questionnaire study, adults rated double-object forms with novel verbs as sounding etter if they met these criteria. In an analysis of speech transcripts, children were found to produce ungrammatical double-object sentences (though not very frequently). In two experiments children were taught novel motion  verbsl they extended them to double-object structures, and did so more often for monomsyllabic than for polysyllabic verbs and more often to denote a possession transfer than motion to a location. However, children also had a bias to use each verb in the construction they heard it in. Thus children are not invariably conservative but show conservative tendencies, and their generalizations are influenced by morphophonological and semantic criteria. We propose that speakers acquire a dative rule that operates on two levels: a broad-range rule defines the possiblity of a verb menaing 'cause to move' to be changed into one meaning 'cause to have, and narrow-range rules license such extensions to be made for subclasses of semantically and morphologically similar verbs.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses how Chinese, a so-called tenseless language, determines its temporal reference. For simplex sentences without time adverbs or aspectual marker, I show that temporal reference is correlated with aktionsart or grammatical viewpoint. For sentences with an aspecual marker, I discuss the temporal semantics of 'le' and 'guo' in detail, showing how their tense/aspectual meanings contribute to temporal reference. I propose to analyze 'le' as an event realization operator and 'guo' as ananteriority operator. For subordinate clauses, I show that temporal reference of complement clauses of verbs is basically determined by verbal semantics of individual verbs, which may impose some temporal restriction on the temporal location of the embedded event. As for relative clauses and temporal adverbial clauses, many different factors such as lexical verbal semantics, referential properties of determiners, lifteme effect of noun phrases, semantic or pragmatics constraints on termporal connectives, inference rules and world knowledge, etc., all interact to help determine temporal reference. Many data discussed in this paper indicate that there is no evidence of (covert) tenses in Chinese. Therefore, challenging work remains for those who have claimed that Tnese Phrase is projected in Chinese phrase structures.},

	Abstract = {One of the fundamental goals of every phonological theory is to account for the nature of the basic units of speech sounds, and the relationships between these units and their contextual variants. This relationship is equally crucial to the phonological theory whether it is called 'phonemes and allophones', 'unerlying and surface forms', or 'input and output'. However, purely structural analyses of phonological systems can often produce several hypotheses regarding the phonemic inventory and its surface reflexes in any particular language, all of which are supportable by the contrast and alternation patterns of the languages. In this paper we look at four such hypotheses regarding the underlying vowel system of Mandarin, all based on Beijin Mandarin: the six-vowel system of c. Cheng (1973), the five-vowel systems of R. Cheng (1966) and of Lin(1989), and the four-vowel system of Wu (1994). We then present distributiona, phonetic, and psycholinguistic evdence (the latter based on a corpus of 238 syntagmatic speech errors or 'slips of the tongue' involving vowels) that the vowel system of the dialect of Mandarin currently spoken in Taiwan cannot be accounted for by any ofhtese hypotheses. We then propose a new 5-vowel system for Taiwan Mandarin, based ont eh distributional, phonetic, and especially the psycholinguistic facts. We conclude that phonological theories which are compatible with psycholinguistic evidence such as the data presented here are those most likely to be modeling the actual cognitive representations and processes of real speakers.},

	Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to test Chinese children's comprehension of count- and mass-classifiers. The participants for each experiment were 80 Chinese-speaking children between the ages of 3 and 8, plus 16 adults (recruited from Taipei, Taiwan). The results of the study indicate the following points: (1) Chinese children, in early stages of language acquisition (even as young as 3 years), honor the grammatical count-mass distinction which, as suggested by Cheng and Sybesma (1998, 1999), is reflected at the level of the classifier. (2) chinese children are capable of making fine differentiations between and among a given set of count-classifiers. They know that the relationship bewteen a count-classifier and an entity dentoed by a noun is relatively fixed. (3) Chinese children's abilities in dealing with mass-classifiers are comparable  to their abilities in dealing with count-classifiers. (4) Although there are developmental differences across the classifiers tested (presumably due to lexical learning), these differences tend to fade by age 4. (5) The general classifier \emph{ge} differed in that it does not require that the entity denoted by the noun be of a particular type. This was seen even in adults to some degree. The results of this study cohere with the linguistic analysis proposed by Cheng and Sybesma that the count-mass distinction is in fact relevant in chinese grammar. These results also cohere with the current theory in cognitive development proposed by Soja, Carey and Spelke (1991) that the ontological constraint reflected in the count-mass distinction is available in early stages of language acquisition.},

In contrast to the diachronic account presented in Li (1977), which assumes, based on cognate comparison among Rukai dialects, that Maga mid vowels derive historically from Proto Rukai, the current work draws evidence from alternations found in Maga and proposes that the mid vowels are not inherited nor underlyingly present but are surface variants of high vowels., generated by synchronic processes. Two other phenomena, echo vowel insertion and \emph{e~r/o~v} alternation, are examined in connection with mid vowel formation. It is shown in the discussion that the proposed synchronic approach not only provides an answer to soem unresolved issues related to Maga mid vowels, thus shedding light on our understanding of Maga's vocalic inventories, but also reveals the interactions among various processes and hence offers insight into the unified mechanisms that tie together the alternations in the language.},

@article{Liu:2003,
	Abstract = {Chinese anaphors can be divided into two semantic types: One (the \emph{X-benshen} 'X-self' anaphor, in which X is either \emph{ziji} 'self' or \emph{pronoun-ziji} 'pronoun-self') reuires pure identity with its antecedent; the other (the \emph{non-X-benshn} 'non-X-self' anaphor) allows near identity with its antecedent. Pure identity shown by the anphor \emph{ziji-benshen} 'self-self' can be derivable from the semanti composition of the near reflexive funtion of the morpheme z\emph{iji} 'self', the focus function of the morpheme \emph{benshen} 'self' and the operator status of \emph{ziji-benshen} 'self-self' while near identity (or near reflexivity) wshown by the \emph{non-X-benshen }'non-X-self' anaphor is due to its being"a pronoun in coreference." In other words, in Chinese pure identity is near reflexivity plus a focus marker which picks out the best representation of the antecedent that happens to be the actual person. Thus, the \emph{X-benshen }'X-self' anaphor should not be considered a pure anaphor without content. Typologically, there are two ways for human languages to get pure identity: One is by using an anaphorwithout content; the other is by using a focus marker that picks out the best representation of the antecedent which happens to be the actual person. The typological difference in establishing pure identity provides an answer for the long standing question of why the notion of coargumenthood is often adopted by linguists in defining binding conditions in languages which show an antilocality effect but seldom in Chinese. The distribution and coindexation of all Chinese anaphors, either the \emph{X-bensen} 'X-self' or the \emph{non-X-benshen} 'non-X-self' anaphor, are determined by one single syntactic condition, namely, the traditional binding theory, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the coargument domain. In contrast, in languages which show an antlocality effect, the binding theory allows both pure and near anaphors within the coargument domain but Condition R filters out one of them in the absence of lexical/morphological reflexivity; however, outside the coargument domain, the binding theory itself governs the distribution and coindexation of all anaphors.},

	Abstract = {This paper provides a systematic semantic account of the auxiliary verb pair "a/e noh" and "a/e twu" in Korean, which have been commonly assumed in the leterature to express the perfect as synonyms, indicating the event described by their main clause complements has ended. Contrary to this common assumption, this paper argues that "a noh" is a dynamic event description, focusing on culmination, whereas "a twu" is static, triggering a presupposition about the causal event. This opposition corresponds to a difference between asserting the completion of an event and asserting a current state resulting from a past event that is presupposed to have already taken place. This paper provides empirical evidence supporting this claim: the two markers are distinguished when embedded in change of state predicates in sentences. In discourse, "a noh" describes a following/preceding episode, whereas "a twu" expresses an overlapping state. The semantic differences between the two have been represented formally using the logical tools of Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle (1993)). In DRT, "a noh" moves the reference time (Rpt) forward, while "a twu" represents a state preserving the give Rpt.},

It is argued. partly on the basis of strengthened and refined old arguments and partly on the basis of novel ones, that the two kinds of free relatives are unified by the following core of properties: (i) they are complex XPs, consisting of an overt CP adn a null head (with internal structure), (ii) they are multi-categorial, and (iii) their semantic interpretation involves the application of a uniqueness operator to a set obtained by abstraction. The special effects associated with transparent free relatives result from the following combination of factors (which may be encountered separately, in which case they do not induce transparency effects): (a) the \emph{wh}-element in [Spec, CP] binds the subject of a small clause, (b) the small clause is of the equative-specificational type, (c) abstraction at the CP level applies to an unrestricted property variable, and (d) the \emph{wh}-element is syntacticially and semantically underspecified. The cumulative effect of these factors is that the small-clause predicate is perceived as, and in certain ways also functions as, a syntactici and semantic 'nucleus' of the comlex XP and thus exhibits head-like properties.},

Evidence comes principally from the analysis of pseudo-gapping, in which the ellipsis remnant is extracted to a position outside of the VP which deletes. Anaphors cannot appear as ellipsis remnants when the antecedent is within the deleted material. The interaction of anaphora and ellipsis is mirrored by restrictions on scrambling of anaphors in Dutch object scramblign and a unified analysis is proposed. The paper draws implications for other theories of constituency, such as Phillips (1996), as well as for the A-status of the ellipsis remnant, \emph{contra} Jayaseelan (1999).

	Abstract = {Semitic templates systematically encode two dimensions of verb meaning: (a) \emph{agency}, the thematic role of the verb's external argument, and (b) \emph{voice}. The assumption that this form-meaning correspondence is mediated by syntax allows the parallel compositional construction of the form and the meaning of a verb from teh forms and the meanings of its root and template. The root and its arguments are optionally embedded under a light verb v which introduces the agent (Hale and Keyser 1993; Kratzer 1994). but this is only the unmarked case, which, in Semitic, is encoded by the \emph{simple} templates. Two dinensions of markedness are introduced by two addtional types of syntactic heads: (a) \emph{agency heads}, which modify agnecy and are morphologically realized as the \emph{intensive} and \emph{causative} etmplates, and (b) \emph{voice heads}, which modify voice and are morphologically realized as the \emph{passive} and \emph{middle} templates. Causative and middle moprhemes are thus accounted for within a unified system, which, first explains their affinity in language in general (both are found crosslinguisticslly as markers of trnasitivey alternations), and which, moreover, sheds new light on problems in the interface of semantics and morphology. One problem is the impossibility, mostly ignored int he linguistic theory, of deriving the sematnics of middle verbs from that of the corresponding transitive verbs. The secon dis explaining the identity found crosslinguistically between middle and refelxive moephology. The third is determining the grammatical function of the causee in causative constructions.},

First, I show that in cases of temporal mismatch, [past] cannot be interpreted inside the proposition where it occurs at surface structure. In stead, it must be interpreted as constraining the time argument of the accessibility relation. This has the effect of shifting the time of the evaluation of the conditional to some contexturally salient past time. Second, I will propose specific felicity conditions (presuppositions) for subjunctive conditionsals and I will argue that there is a strict correspondence between the time of evaluation in the truth conditions of a conditiional and the time relevant for the felicity conditions. In other words, if the time relevant for the accessibility relation has been shifted to the past, then the conditional's presupposition will make reference to a past context. On the other hand, if no past is constraining the time argument of the accessibility relation, the conditional's felicity will make reference to the current (main) context. Third, I will argue that the intuation that the antecedent of mismatche counterfactuals is not true is a scalar implicature arising from a competition not between assertions but between presuppositions. Finally, I will investigate the repercussions of my proposal for hte general theory of modality.},

We also discuss the circumstances in which a n overt cmoplementizer and a robustly inflected verb license pro, rendering the clitic redundant. The comparative interest of this dialect is that it reveals synchronically the three mechanisms of pro licensing available in Romance diachronically. These are (a) association with rich verbal inflection, (b) government by a complementizer, and (c) doubling by a clitic.

The arguments of the light vrb are inherited from its non-light counterpart but interpreted with respect to the Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) of its complement. On the basis of this and other observations, this work proposes an explicit decomposition of arguments into (i) \emph{argument-variables,} encoding argument properties but isolated from LCS and therefore void of interpretation, and (ii) \emph{thematic indices}, linking argument-variables to LCS and thus enabling their interpretation. The proposed decomposition provides a deeper understanding of the operations affecting argument structures in complex predicates, recasting \emph{light verb formation, thematic transfer}, and \emph{argument suppression}, in terms of finer grained operations exclusively targeting either argument-variables or thematic indices.},

@article{Ayad:2003,
	Abstract = {This paper argues for a distinction between word formation from roots and word formation from existing words. Focusing on Hebrew, it is shown that roots -- and only roots -- may be assigned multiple interpretations in different environments. When the basis for the derivation is a word, this word forces its semantic and phonological properties on any element derived from it. To account for this difference, a locality constraint on the interpretation of roots is postulated: the first nominal or verbal head that merges with the root serves as the immediate environment for determining its interpretation. This head forms a closed domain: any further derivation takes as its input not the root iteslf, but an element whose semantic and phonological properties have been cased out. Word-derived words thus have access only to thewords they are derived from, not to the root. While the ability of hebrew roots to acquire multiple interpretations is language specific, the distinction between word fromation from roots and word formation from words is shown to be universal. This is illustrated here with English zero-related pairs, which are shown to ehibit the same contrasts as Hebrew bewteen word formation from roots and from words. Showing the effect of roots in word formation in both Hebrew and English further motivates the root hypothesis, namely, that in all languages the lexical kernel, or the root, is distinct from 'words' -- complex entities -- even if this distinction is not always morphologically manifested.},

Using both naturally occurring and constructed data we explore the interaction f these operators with negative polarity items, with presupposition, with prosodically reduced elements, and with syntactic extraction. On the basis of this data we show that while \emph{only} lexically encodes a dependency on the placement of focus, \emph{always} does not. Rather, the focus sensitivity of \emph{always} results from its dependency on context, and from the fact that focus also refelcts what is given in the context.

@article{Chung:2003,
	Abstract = {In the modular linguistic theory assumed by many generative linguists, phonology and syntax are interconnected but fundamentally independent components of grammar. The effects of syntax on phonology are mediated by prosodic structure, a representation of prosodic constituents calculated from syntactic structure but not isomorphic to it. Within this overall architecture, I investigate the placement of weak pronouns in the Austronesian language Chamorro. Certain Chamorro pronominals can be realized as prosodically deficient weak pronouns that typically occur right after the predicate. I show that these pronouns are second-position clitics whose placement is determined not syntactically, but prosodically: they occur after the leftmost phonological phrase of their intonational phrase. My analysis of these clitics assumes that lexical insertion is late and can affect and be affected by prosodic phrase formation -- assumptions consistent with the view that the mutual interaction of phonology and syntax is confined to the postsyntactic operations that translate syntactic structure into prosodic structure.},

Based on relevant and important fats that are overlooked by Koizumi and other researchers, this paper demonstrates that the alleged evidence based on the behavior of numeral classifiers does not support his claim that verb-raising occurs in Japanese. The apparently odd behavior of such classifiers (which can give rise to unusual looking constituents) noted by Koizumi will be given a semantic account. The present account is also capable of dealing with additional data wiht numeral classifiers that are problematic for him.},

I exemplify IP-Inversion using a range of constructions from Russian, and show that the "inverted" constituent has subject (A) properties, and that it is accompanied by verb-raising, which is required in such instances by the Overt Tense Condition. The ability to fill SpecIP with a non-Nominative constituent is a parameterized property of a language related to the strength of the Nominative case features in I. The driving force behind Inversion is (a version of) the (traditional) Extended Projection Principle (EPP), that is an overtness requirement on the specifier of the functional category I. Finally I argue that Inversion, as an overtness requirement on the specifier of a functional projection, can be generalized to the CP level as well, where an equivalent overtness requirement forces filling of SpecCP, as in Germanic V2 languages. The analysis allows us to unite various apparently disparate constructions as the result of a simple set of parameters, and to expose central issues of economy within the computational system.},

@article{Beninca:2004,
	Abstract = {In this paper we document the existence in a Romance language of a strategy to do (fa) insertion in main non-subject interrogatives parallel to the well-known English case. As our description illustrates, the set of contexts where "do"-support applies in this language is a proper subset of the English contexts. The syntax of fa-support in a language with typical Romance features allows us to draw some general conclusions regarding the analysis of English do-support and the interfaces between syntax and morphology, on one side, and syntax and lexical-semantic structure, on the other. First we will show how fa-support in this Romance langauge constitutes evidence in favor of the hypothesis that V to C movement applies also in Romance main questions. Second, some aspects of Rizzi's (1991) proposal that subject sh-sentences have a CP structure with the wh- in SpecC is confirmed by the presence of an overt complementizer in the language we are dealing with. Thirdly, the phenomenon of Romance fa-support will lead us to further develop Pollock's idea that do-insertion is directly connected with the theta-grid of a verb: a main verb cannot move to a thematically opaque position, while auxiliaries can, as they do not have a theta-grid. In the Romance dialect we analyze some verbs move to C (or use do-support) independently of their use as auxiliaries or as main verbs. In order to account for this aspect of the phenomenon, we suggest a more detailed description of the process.},

@article{Frisch:2004,
	Abstract = {It has long been known that verbal roots containing homorganic consonant pairs are rare in Arabic, motivating the existence of an OCP-Place constraint (Obligatory Contour Principle on place of articulation) in the phonological grammar. We explore this constraint using an on-line lexicon of Arabic roots. The strength of the constraint is quantified by the ratio of the observed number of example of each consonant pair to the number that would be statistically expected under random combination of phonemes. We show that the srength of the effect over all pairs is a gradient funciton of the similarity of the consonants in the pair. A similarity metric based on natural classes is developed, whcih solves the formal difficulties of contrastive underspecification theory while preserving the insight that contrastiveness plays an important role in perceived similarity. Thsi metric is applied in an explicit model of the gradient OCP constraint, which achieves a better fit to the regularities and sub-regularities of the Arabic verbal lexicon than any prior approach. Lastly, we review evidence for the psychological reality of the constraint, for its existence in related forms in other languages, and for its cognitive/phonetic foundations in the speech processing system. We argue that the total body of evidence supports a model in which phonetic and cognitive pressures incrementally affect the lexicon, and phonotactic constraints are abstractions over the lexicon of phonological forms.},

The ordering possibilities vary greatly among the dialects, Some of the orders that we found occur only under particular stress assignments. We assume that these orders fulfil an informaiton structural purpose and that the reordering processes are changes only in the linear order of the elements which is represented exclusively at the surface syntactic level, PF. Our Optimality theoretic account offers a multifactorial perspective on the phenomenon.},

	Abstract = {In this article, I argue for a remnant movement approach to German V/2 constructions that does not employ head movement at any step of the derivation: the pre-V/2 (topic) position and the V/2 position collapse into a single fronted remnant vP. the central theoretical innovation is a constraint on the movement of phases: the Edge Domain Pied Piping Condition (EPC) permits vP movement only if vP is reduced to its edge domain. the analysis is supported by the observation that items which are obligatory vP edges always show up in the pre-v?2 position in v?2 clauses (\emph{wh}-phrases, expletives) and that items which are impossible vP edges never show up in the pre-V/2 position (weak object pronouns, certain object CPs). Furthermore, the new approach is shown to account for other conspicuous properties of German V/2 constructions (concerning the internal islandhood and external distribution of V/2 clauses)and to be compatible with evidence involving constituency tests, mismatches between verb-final and V/2 clauses, and (apparently) complex prefields. The article concludes with remarks on how the analysis can be extended to other Germanic V/2 languages and V/1 and V/3 constructions and how the EPC can be derived from a more general identification requirement for phases.},

The contribution of Heycock and Zamparelli (2003) is a serious attempt to fill this gap, but the details of their analysis lead to predictions that are not correct for French. I show that CBNs exhibit surprisingly unifrom behavior across langauges, unlike BPs, which are subject to crosslinguistic variatio, as sketched by Longobardi (2001). to account for these facts, I propose a modificaiton of Heycock and Zamparelli's analysis of CBNs.},

	Abstract = {This article evaluates a promotion-based analysis for Semitic relatives along the lines of Kane 1994 and compares it with an alternative analysis that does not make use of promotion but shares with Kayne's analysis an antisymmetric view of phrsae structure. The alternative analysis is based on establishing a parametric distinction relating to categorial identity of the relative clause such that it is a CP in some languages and a DP in others. The first type is found in languages where the relative complementizer is the same as teh normal complementizer of sentential complementation (e.g., Hebrew). The second type is found in languages where the relative complementizer is a determiner (e.g., Amharic and Arabic). this difference is shown to have crucial implications for the structure and derivation of N-initial and N-final relatives, as well as for some relevant typological generalizations, including a generalization relating to the phenomenon of (relative) clause nominalization.},

If \emph{have}, \emph{get}, and \emph{give} all contain the abstract preposition P_{have} (Harley 1995, Richards 2001), however, Fodor and Lepore's treatment may be appropriately revised: the element introduced by \emph{want} is not \emph{have} but P_{have}.

The IDL does this by attempting to construct grammars for combinations of interpretations of the overt forms, and discarding those combinations that are inconsistent. the potential of this algorithm for overcoming the combinatorial growth in combinations of interpretations is supported by computational results from an implementation of the IDL using an optimality-theoretic system of metrical stress grammars.},

We propose that preposed negation in non-\emph{wh}-questions and preposed negative adverbials in declaratives necessarily contribute focus marking (in particular, verum focus) and argue that the lack of wide scope disjunction reading in both declaratives and non-\emph{wh}-questions results as a by-product of the interaction between focus and the LF syntax of disjunctive structures, which we argue involves ellipsis.},

. The changes examined all show a tendency towards heads and head-checking but execute this in slightly different ways. In addition, innovations introduce new specifiers, and presecriptive rules retain them, counteracting the effects of economy.
     Changes from Head to Head and from Spec to Spec also occur. These proceed typically towards positions higher in the tree and can be explained via a 'merge over move' economy principle. The change involving heads I'll look at is the change of to from preposition \emph{to} complementizer, and the changes involving specifiers involve French negatives and English relatives. Thus, certain instances of grammaticalization can be accounted for in structural terms.},

Turning to the structural properties of the construction, we show that CR is unusual among reduplication phenomena in that whole idioms can be copied, object pronouns are often copied (as in the second example above), and inflectional morphology need not be copied. Thus the 'scope' of CR cannot be defined in purely phonological terms; rather, a combination of phonological, morphosyntactic, syntactic, and lexical factors is involved. We develop an anlysis within the parallel architecture framework of Jackendoff (1997, 2002), whereby CR is treated as a lexical item with syntactic and semantic content and reduplicative phonology. We then sketch an alternative analysis, based on current assumptions within the Minimalist Program, which involves movement into a focusl-like position with both the head and the tail of the resulting chain spelled out.},

Apparent counterexamples to this claim can be shown to involve aspect/Aktionsarten rather than tense. There is consequently no reason to posit any of the funcitonal shell strucure associated wtih tense. Hence, the infinitival markers (\emph{zu}, \emph{te}) may be assumed to be in (or close to) the VP. This is in accordance with the observation that these infintival markers are always directly adjacent to the verb, which makes them similar to the verbal participial prefix \emph{ge-}. A Minimalist account of \emph{zu/te}, which is similar but not identical to \emph{ge-}, is proposed. The question is then raised how \emph{zu} (originally a true local-allative preposition) could have become a verbal prefix, and relevant diachronic data are adduced. Finally it is shown that a functionalist, or `cognitivist', theory of grammaticalization like Haspelmath's misses the point in a number of ways.

In the overt subject languages, subjects are realized in the canonical specifier-of-IP position, whereas in the null subject languages (such as Catalan and Spanish), subjecs are located in a topic/focus position, which becomes acessible only later in development. AS evidence for this, I show that overt subjects, fronted objects, and wh-questions begin to be used at the same point in development in child Catalan and Spanish.

Under the assumption that lexical exceptions can occur in a langauge only if its native speakers can perceive stress contrasts. I argue that the presence of these exceptions depends on the age at which infants discover the stress rule of their language. If the stress regularity is easy to infer from the surface speech stream, then it will be acquired very early, and stress will not be encoded in teh phonological representation of words in the mental lexicon: as a consequence, stress contrasts are not well perceived by adult speakers and lexical exceptions are excluded. If, by contrast, the regularity is difficult to infer, then it will be acquired relatively late, after the format of the phonological encoding of words has been fixed. That is, stress will be redundantly encoded in the mental lexicon, and lexical exceptions can thus be perceived adn stored by adult speakers. A typological survey concerning the occurrence of exceptions in languages with fixed stress supports this proposal. A comparison with a metrical approach to exceptional stress is made, leading to a proposal about the division of labor between psycholinguistcs and theoretical phonology.},

A head may therefore licesne the specifier of its complement (as well as its complement) but not its own specifier (it is not local enough). This effectively elminates the spec-head configuration from the repertoire of syntactic configurations, in favor of a unified notion of locality strictly identifiable with mutual c-command, a symmetric configuration. The discussion shows that a theory that collapses these distinctions remains empirically discriminating. The resulting theory is therefore genuinely reductionist.},

	Abstract = {Most linguistic theories since Chomsky (1973) have hypothesized that long-distance dependencies crossing multiple clauses are mediated by intermediate structures. This paper provides a new source of evidence for the existence of such intermediate structures: reading times during online sentence comprehension. The experiment presented here compares reading times for two structures involving the long-distance extraction of a \emph{wh}-filler: (a) a structure in which a clause intervenes bewteen the endpoints of the extraction, and (b) a structure in which a nominalization of the clause intervenes. The logic of the experiment relies on two hypotheses: first, that intermedieate structures mediate the relationship bewteen a \emph{wh}-filler and its theta-role-assigning verb when a clause interves between them but not when a nominalizaiton intervenes; and second, that reading times for a word increase as linear distance increases between teh word and the position on which it is dependent in the partial structure for the input (Gibson 1998, 2000; Grodner, Watson \& Gibson 2000). In combination, these hypotheses predict that reading times at the region in which the verb assigns a theta-role to the \emph{wh}-filler will be faster in the clausal conditions whan in the nominalized conditions, because in the clausal conditions intermediate structure mediate the \emph{wh}-filler verb dependency and case it to be more local. This prediction was confirmed.},

	Abstract = {Complex noun phrases crosslinguistically contain meaningless elements whose sole function is to serve as linkers of predicates to their subjects -- thus, Mandarin Chinese \emph{de} links inverted AP predicates to their subjects as well as possesssors, PPs, relative clauses, and noun-complement clauses (e.b., \emph{the claim that John was asleep}). Taking a comparative analysis of French \emph{de} and Thai \emph{Thii} as its point of departure, this paper argues for a maximally generalized account of the noun phrases in which linkers occur, in terms of DP-internal Predicate Inversion. This approach prompts an analysis of relative-clause constructions that recognizes relative clauses as predicates of DP-internal small clauses, combining the attractions of the traditional approach adn teh Vergnaud/Kayne raising approach by assigning relative clauses an internal structure similar to the traditional one while giving it the external distribution of a predicate by treating it as the predicate of a noun-phrase-internal small clause. For noun-complement cluases, teh approach leads to a revitalization of Stowell's (1981) predication approach to the relationship between teh head noun adn the clause, the latter serving as the former's subject in a DP-contained small-clause structure. A uniform linker approach to French \emph{de}, Tha \emph{thii}, Mandarin Chinese \emph{de}, Japnaese \emph{no}, and so on (a) emphasizes the pervasiveness of Predicate Inversion in the noun phrase, (b) confirms the role of linkers as purely functional aides to the inversion operation, (c) furthers our understanding of the structure and derivaiton of complex noun phrases, and (d) presents a particularly interesting window on microparametric variation in the syntax of noun phrases.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an LFG-based analysis of coordination in terms of (non-headed) sets of f-structures and the distribution of grammatical funcitonal information across sets. This approach provides a descriptively adequate account of key properties of coordination, including the distribution of grammatical funcitons across all conjuncts, the ability to coordinate unlike categories under certain syntactic conditions, and the non-distribution of lexical properties such as tense and number. Coordination is subject to the condition that items can be conjoined if and only if they satisfy the condition of functional equivalence. This condition does not have to be stipulated; it follows as an axiom from the general principles of functional application to sets. Since coordination is not a headed construction, there is not percolation path for features from individual categories within a coordinate structure to the node dominating the coordination. therefore lexical properties will not be shared across the coordination as a whole. The lack of distributivity allows individual conjuncts to differ in terms of lexical properties. In particular, it is expected, rather than exceptional, that coordinated NPs may differ in number, person, case and gender. The proposed account also predicts a high level of idiosyncrasy and variability with respect to 'agreement' between the subject NP and the verb and/or predicate complement.},

	Abstract = {It is generally held that clausal temporal, aspectual and modal featuers, when encoded morphologically, are expressed by or on clasal heads. However nominals and modifiers within NP can also be inflected for tense, aspect and modal features interpreted with respect to the clausal predication rather than with respect to the nominal argument itself. Such nominals (and dependents within NP) therefore contribute syntactic tense, aspect and mood features to the clause, but do not themselves have syntactically active TAM features. Building on previous work we show how a simple account of this phenomenon can be given in the lexicalist, constraint-based theory of LFG. In particular, the use of inside-out funciton application in LFG permits us to capture direclty the role of nominal morphology in defining clausal TAM properties without recourse to derivational or feature passing mechanisms.},

@article{Hay:2004,
	Abstract = {There is a long-standing debate about the principles and mchanisms that constrain the combinatorial properties of affixes, in particular of English suffixes. One group of scholars argues for the existence of lexical strata with strong restrictions holding between the different strata. This view is disputed by scholars who claim that it is selectional restrictions of individual suffixes that are responsible for hte combinatorial properties of suffixes. Most recently, Hay (2000, 2002) has proposed a psycholinguistic model of morphological complexity, according to which an affix whihc can be easily parsed out in processing should not occur inside an affix which cannot. This model has been called "complexity based ordering". The general claim is that affixes can be approximately ordered along a hierarchy of complexity, with more spearable affixes at one end, and less sparable affixes at the other end. More separable affixes can attach outside less separable affixes, but not vice-versa. The goal of this paper is to test the predicionts of complexity based ordering hrough an investigation of 15 English suffixes and their potential 210 two-suffix combinations. Using large data-bases such as the British National Corpus, the CELES lexical database, the OED and the internet, we investigate whether the attested and non-attested combinations are best explained by complexity based ordering or by the individual selectional properteis of these sufixes. We show that in most cases selectional restrictions and parsing restrictions coincide. Where sleectional restrictions underdeterine possible combinations, complexity based ordering makes correct predictions. Only easily parsable combinations are possible combinations, and this range of possible combinations is then further curtailed by selectional restrictions. In sum, we argue that both selecitonal restrictions and parsing constraints are instrumental in determining possible and impossible suffix combinations.},

	Abstract = {According to Chomsky's Binding Theory (cf. Chomsky 1981), the distribution of anaphors, pronouns, and R-expressions is regulated by three principles: Principle A, B, and C. Although the predictions of these principles are very often borne out, they cannot account for phenomena likek long distance anaphors, the difference between different types of anaphors, data where anaphors and pronouns are not in complementary distribution, or languages like Vietnamese in whihc R-expressions may be bound. The aim of this paper is therefore to develop a theory of binding which captures these phenomena. Based on a close analysis of Englihs, German, dutch, Italian, and Icelandic, I show that these apprent exceptions can easily be intergrated into a uniform theory of binding it if is assumed that the principles that regulate bidnign are violable. Thus I will present an optimality-theoretic analysis that makes it possible to account for the occurrence of simplex anaphors, complex anaphors, pronouns, and R-expression in a uniform and straightforward way. The approach is based on the interaction of two universal constraint hierarchies. One of them takes into account the fact that biding is sensitive to domains of different size; the other one prohibits elements of different anaphoric degree. On the bases of these two constraint hierarchies, the competition selects the optimal element in a given context.},

	Abstract = {This paper integrates Japanese object honorification within a larger crosslinguistic context, and provides a principled explanation for an otherwise puzzling property: the fact that direct object honorificaiton is blocked in the presence of a dative argument. Following a well-established tradition in generative literature, we regard honorification as a case of agreement, but, unlike previous approaches, which rely on Spec-Head configurations, we show that Chomsky's (2000) Agree mechanism suffices for (object) agreement to obtain. We argue that the blocking effect of dative elements is a reflex of a more gneeral locality constraint, 'defective intervention', proposed by Chomsky 2000. The analysis also provides a compelling argument in favor of taking the <indirect object; direct object> order in Japanese as basic, and against base-generation approaches to scrambling.},

	Abstract = {The psychological reality of English phonaesthemes is demonstrated through a priming experiment with native speakers of American English. Phonaesthemes are well-represented sound-meaning pairings, such as English "gl-", which occurs in numerious words with meanings relating to light and vision. In the experiment, phonaesthemes, despite being noncompositional in nature, displayed priming effects much like those that have been reported for compositional morphemes. These effects could not be explained as the result of semantic or phonological priming, either alone or in combination. The results support a view of the lexicon in which shared form and meanign across words is a key factor in their relatedness, and in which morphological composition is not required for internal word structure to play a role in langauge processing.},

An analysis of deferred equatives (\emph{I'm the pad thai}) suggests an alternative account based on teh notion of pragmatic mapping: a contextually licensed mappin operation between (sets of) discourse entities, neither of which undergoes a transfer of meaning. Moreover, the use of a derferred equative requires the presence of a contextually licensed open proposition whose instantiation encodes the particular mapping between entities, both of which remain accessible to varying degrees within the discourse model. Finally, it is shown how a complete account of deferred reference must provide for transfers of reference as well as sense.},

We argue that many of them can be subsumed under a single simple principle, motivated by considerations of processing effciency: to the extent that the domains of syntactic and semantic dependencies can be minimized, processing is facilitated. We use a more precise formulation of this idea to make several predictions about the distribution of particles based on teh size of hte object NP and the semantic dependencies among the verb, the particle, and the object. Corpus studies confirm the predictions, providing evidence for the principle of domain minimization.},

@article{Hume:2004,
	Abstract = {This paper addresses three key observations relating to crosslinguistic patterns of metathesis. First, the order of sounds resulting from metathesis can differ from language to language such that a similar combination of sounds can be realized in one order in one language, but in the reverse order in another language. Second, for some sound combinations, only one order is commonly attested as the result of metathesis, while for other combinations, either order can be observed. Third, the acoustic/auditory cues to the identification of the sequence resulting from metathesis are often bettern than those of the expected, yet nonoccurring, order. These patterns receive a straightforward explanation when we consider the phonetic nature of the sounds ivolved as well as the speaker/hearer's knowledge of native sound patterns and their frequency of occurrence. Neither factor alone is sufficient to provide a predictive account of metathesis. This study shows, however, that by taking into account both factors, we are able to understand why certain soundn combinations tend to undergo metathesis, why others are common results of metathesis, why patterns of metathesis differ across languages, and importantly, why metathesis occurs in the first place.},

The analysis identifies distinct stative participles that derive from the different heights at which aspectual morphemes attach in a verbalizing structure. The Aspect head involved in resultative participles is shown to attach to a vP that is also found in (a) the formation of deadjectival verbs and (b) verb phrases with resultative secondar predicates, like \emph{John hammered the metal flat}. These distinct constructions are shown to have a shared structural subcomponent. The analysis proposed here is compared with Lexicalist approaches employing the verbal versus adjectival passive distinction. It is shown that a uniformly syntactic anlysis of the participles is superior to the Lexicalist alternative.},

@article{Hazout:2004a,
	Abstract = {This article outlines an account of the syntax of existential constructions (e.g., \emph{There are too many problems}) based on a view of the postcopular NP as a predicate. This NP figures as the predicate in an embedded clausal complement of \emph{be} with expletive \emph{there} as its subject. \emph{There} consequently moves to the higher Spec, IP position for Case-theoretic reasons. Existential constructions and existential interpretation are a particular instance of a wider phenomenon involving the use of predicates of various categories with expletive subjects (e.g., \emph{It is cold).} Long-distance agreement between the main (inflected) verb and the postcopluar NP is a combined effect of the relation of subject-predicate agreement holding between the expletive subject (\emph{there}) and a predicate NP within the embedded clausal structure and the relation of specifier-head agreement (feature checking) bewteen the arised expletive and the matrix I/T. This analysis is generalized to other cases of long-distance agreement (e.g., \emph{There appeared a man}). It is shown that an analysis based on teh notion \emph{Agree} (Chomsky 2000) is empirically inadequate. Well-known restrictions on the distribution of NPs/DPs in existential constructions follow from the proposed analysis.},

In pairs of adjectives such as 'safe-dangerous', 'clean-dirty' and 'healthy-sick', the first ("total") adjective describes lack of danger, dirt malady, etc., while the second ("partial") adjective describes the existence of such properties. It is shown that the semantics of adjective phrases with modifiers such as 'almost', 'slightly', and 'completely' is sensitive to whether the adjective is total or partial. The interpretation of such modified constructions is accounted for using a novel 'scale structure' for total and partial adjectives. It is proposed that the standard value of a total adjective is always fixed as the lower bound of the corresponding partial adjective. By contrast, the standard value of partial adjectives can take any point on the partial scale. The effects of this theoretical distinction on the behavior of modified constructions are studied in detail, and their ramifications for the semantic theory of adjectives are discussed. Some other phenomena are surveyed that show evidence for total and partial adjectival constructions with various comparatives and exceptive phrases.},

We argue that there are two clitic positions in Itlaian "restructured" clauses: one associated with the (restructured) lexical verb and the other a clausal clitic position located in the functional domain. While restructuring can be recursive, clitics appear either on the restructured infinitive (no clitic climbing) or in the functional domain of the highest verb (full clitic climbing). There is no clitic climbing to an intermediate restructuring verb. We argue that only the lowest restructured verb makes a position for clitics available and that this position is the same as that of infinitive-final [e]. Finally, we show that the funcitonal - lexical dichotomy is too sharp and that a variety of verb classes must be admitted, whose properties correlate with the point in the sturcture in which they are merged.},

A key theoretical mechanism is feature copying, which derives the core part of Neg-Factorization and is also shown to provide the foundation for the notion of chains defined in terms of occurrences. The proposed analysis of negative concord supports Merchant's (2001) theory of ellipsis, according to which ellipsis is PF deletion and requires semantic identity. I also discuss in detail how morphology interacts with properties of negative conord, taking into account wide-ranging crosslinguistic patterns.},

	Abstract = {This article presents a new analysis of full-root reduplication in Klamath. This process, hitherto termed "intensive" reduplication, has previously been analyzed as involving prefixation. Klamath prefixes normally induce vowel reduction in the following morpheme, but the intensive reduplicant does not. McCarthy and Prince (1995) attempt to account for this divergent behavior by invoking base-reduplicant faithfulness; Zoll (2002) attributes it to a stem-internal/stem-external distinction among prefixes. Based on phonological and semantic criteria, our analysis presolves intensive reduplication into several classes, including both prefixing and suffixing types. This analysis improves empirical coverage over previous accounts while minimizing assumptions and demonstrates that careful morphological and phonological analysis can distinguish between prefixing and suffixing copying in cases of seemingly ambiguous total reduplication.},

It is shown that the issue is part of a broader descriptive generalization that quantifiers cannot float in theta-positions. The generalization is shown to follow from an interaction of independently motivated assumptions concerning the structure of floating quantifier constructions and the mechanism of adjunction. The analysis of quantifier float proposed in the paper is shown to have important consequences for a number of issues and phenomena, including clausal structure, PP structure, object shift, cliticization, V-movement, Case licensing, small clauses, scope reconstruction, pied-piping, and heavy NP shift. Regarding PP structure, the paper pursues the clause/PP parallelism hyptothesis: it is shown that there is a clause/PP parallelims with respect to Case-licensing, V/P movement, cliticization, and object shift.},

For ASL classifeirs, we claim that there are two basic syntactic types: those that are associated with the internal argument and those that are associated with an external agentive argument. We claim that classifiers project syntactically as (functional) heads and that they determine the status (as external or internal) of the argument that lands in their Spec. We identify a discrete agentive morpheme in ASL classifier constructions, on phonological and syntactic grounds, a morpheme with is responsible for the agentive readings in two types of classifers. The phonological representaiton needed to express this morpheme expands the range of possibilities of templates used in prosodic morphology. This paper contributes to general linguistic theory in providing support for a (morpho-)syntactic analysis of argument structure alternations and in demonstrating how morphological templates can be used to account for the relation between morphological and phonological form in ASL classifiers.},

However, ample crosslinguistic evidence demonstrates that PRO is case-marked just like nay other DP. The phenomenon of \emph{finite} \emph{control} in the Balkan languages and in Hebrew, where subjunctive complements exhibit OC, demonstrates that the licensing of PRO must be sensitive to the distribution of the features [Tense] and [Agr] both on I and C. OC is conceived as an instance of Agree; a local calculus, interacting with feature checking and deletion, determines that PRO is in general the ``elsewhere'' case of referential subjects. However, the two types of subjects may alternate in certain environmnets, an inexplicable fact for most existing accounts. The system proposed naturally extends to other types of complements, like inflected infinitives and obviative subjunctives. The resulting typology offers a systematic picture of the intricate ways in which finiteness and control interact in different languages.},

Our interpretation of these results is that when a phonological contrast like place or voicing is first acquired, it remains only partially integrated and can be lost under the processing demands of word learning.

It also focuses on a few Indo-European languages (French, Greek, and particularly English), but refers to a wider range of language types. While not an exhaustive account of hte variations in name syntax and morphology, significant variation is nevertheless encountered and analyzed. The suggested universal aspects have some plausibility. I propose that names belong universally, with pronouns and determiners, to a category of determinative. The behavior of names as vocatives and in predications of nomination suggests that they are, unlike pronouns and determiners, inherenlty neither defintie nor indefinite. Moreover, in such circumstances names do not function as regular arguments of the predicator; they do not bear a specified semantic relation to the predicator: they are either extrasentential or appositive. In order to figure as arguments in other types of predication, and be assigned a specified semantic relation, names must acquire definiteness. languages differ in whether definiteness is signaled overtly or not: in English, for instance, definite names are not distinguished in form from nondefinite, whereas in greek definite use of a name is marked by an accompanying article. Other languages vary.},

@article{Goldberg:2004,
	Abstract = {English reultative expressions have been a major focus of research on the syntax-semantics interface. We argue in this article that a family of related constructions is required to account for their distribution. We demonstrate that a number of generalizations follow from the semantics of the constructions we posit: the syntactic argument structure of the sentence is predicted by general principles of argument linking: and the aspectual structure of the sentence is determined by the aspectual structure of the constructional subevent, which is in turn predictable from general principles correlating event structure with change, extension, motin, and paths. Finally, the semantics and syntax of resultatives explain the possibilities for temporal relations between the two subevents. While these generalizations clearly exist, there is also a great deal of idiosyncrasy involved in resultatives. many idiosyncratic instances and small subclasses of the construction must be learned and stored individually. This account serves to justify aspects of what we share in our overall vision of grammar, what we might call the constructional view. To the extent that our treatment of the resultative can be stated only within the constructional view, it serves as evidence for this view as a whole.},

These constructions have been instrumental in arguments against dispensing with the operation of Quantifier Raising (QR) and a level of Logical Form (LF) (e.g., May 1985; Fiengo \& May 1994; Fox 1999, 2000). In fact, it has been argued that in ACD constructions, the binding principles apply at LF (e.g., Fiengo \& May 1994). The present paper assesses 4- and 5-year old children's knowledge of ACD constructions in which principles B and C are relevant. The empirical findings show that children interpret these ACD structures like adults, suggesting that they invoke the binding principles at LF, andtarge vP, rather than IP as the landing site for QR, as claimed for adults by Fox (2000) and others. These central properties of ACD construcitons in child grammars present a challenge to learning-based theories of language development, because the input to children cannot inform them how to interpret the ellipsis site of ACD structures or which binding principle is in effect. Nevertheless, preschool children are found to have adultlike interpretations of the structures investigated here. the data are taken to provide support for hte view that binding principles are part of our innate human endowment for language.},

Pingding infixation not only creates onset clusters but also introduces a phoneme. Both features are otherwise not found elsewhere in the language. We argue that the infix -l-, which is cognate with the diminutive -r suffix in other Mandarin dialects, is the result of rhotic metathesis (cf. Blevins and Garrett (1998)). This study shows that Pingding infixation presents an interesting challenge to the theory that claims sound change/metathesis is perceptually optimizing and that it is goal-driven (Hume (1997, 1998, 2001), Steriad (2001)). In this paper, we advance a theory of the origin of Pingding infixation, based on the listener-oriented (i.e., 'innocent') view of sound change (Ohala (1993)), which accounts for the appearance of -l- as an excrescent segment through acoustic means, rather than articulatory (Chen (1992)) or phonotactic ones (Lin (2002)).},

The contrast between tense and lax stops raises two theoretical problems. First, to distinguish them either a new feature [tense] is needed, or the contrast in voicing (or aspiration) must be increased from two to three. Either way there is a large increase in the number of possible stops in the world's languages, but the expansion lacks support beyond Korean. Second, initial aspirated and tense consonants correlate with a high tone, and lax and voiced consonants correlate with a low tone. The correlation cannot be explained in the standard tonogenesis model (voiceless-high and voiced-low). We argue instead that (a) underlyingly ``tense'' stops are regular voiceless unaspirated stops, and ``lax'' stops are regular voiced stops, (b) there is no compelling evidence for a new distinctive feature, and (c) the consonant-tone correlation is another case of voiceless-high and voiced-low.

The internal domain of a transitive verb is therefore somewhat syntactically articulated, containing at least two positions for indefinite objects. Quantified objects, however, are VP external.},

	Abstract = {Frequent words tend to shorten (see e.g., Schuchardt 1885, Hooper 1976), as do words that have a high probability of occurrence given a neighboring word (Jurafsky et al. 2001). This tendency has been cited in support of the claim that probabilities are an inherent part of grammar, and of syntax in particular. There is widespread consensus, however, that the syntax of natural languages cannot be captured in terms of item-to-item transitions (Chomsky 1957). Therefore, unless one considers probabilities of syntactic structures, rather than particular combinations of neighboring words, pronunciation variation cannot be said to reflect probabilistic effects in syntax. In this article we report a case of pronunciation variation that reflects contextual probabilites of syntactic structures. The relevant probabilities are based on the probability of a given syntactic structure, given a particular verb. We show that these probabiliteis affect American English /t,d/-deletion, as well as the durations of words and phrases. Our results are consistent with the notion that knowledge of grammar includes knowledge of probabilites of syntactic structures, and that this knowledge affects language production.},

	Abstract = {It is a general assumption in linguistic theory that the categories of tense, aspect, and mood (TAM) are inflectional categories of verbal classes only. In a number of languages around the world, however, nominals and other NP constituents are also inflected for these categories. In this article we provide a comprehensive survey of tense/aspect/mood marking on NP constituents across the world's languages. Two distinct types are identified: propositional nominal TAM, whereby the nominal carries TAM information relevant to the whole proposition, and independent nominal TAM, in which the TAM information encoded on the nominal is relevant only to the NP on which it is marked -- independent of the TAM of the clause as a whole. We illustrate these different types and their various properties using data from a wide range of languages showing that, while certainly unusual, the phenomenon of nominal tense/aspect/mood marking is far less marginal than is standardly assumed. Nominal TAM inflection must be accpeted as a real possibility in universal grammatical structure, having significant implications for many aspects of linguistic theory.},

For others, morphological structure is autonomous, and syncretism provides direct evidence of this. In this article, I discuss two phenomena that argue for the second view.

It is also argued that Chinese has two light verbs: the static light verb \emph{slv} adnt he dynamic light verb \emph{dlv}. These two light verbs, in conjunction with the lexical verbs, determine the event structures of thepredicates in Chinese, and furthermore serve as the basis for the syntactic agreement of the aspectuality between the SFPs and the predicates.

Since this is thought not likely to be accidental, the reasonable conclusions are that \emph{-tu/-nu} selection and \emph{hebben/zijn} selection are essentially the same phenomenon, and it is by the very nature of this phenomenon that verbs like Formal and functional approaches to language have been at odds with each other for some time.

I believe that there are at least two types of null objects in Chinese, namely the EA and teh variable. The former must occur in a pragmatically oriented environment where a pragmatically downgraded internal protagonisted antecedent is available while the latter may occur in a pragmatically neurtral environment. Seen in this way, Xu's examples at first sight appear to be problematic for Huang's (1982, 1984a,b and 1987) Null Topic Analysis, but upon closer scrutiny turn out not to apply the Empty Antilogophoric Analysis of the Chinese null object in Xu's examples has two theoretical and empirical implicaitons: first, the proposal is reminiscent of Dubinsky and Hamilton's (1998) Antilogophoric Analysis of English epithets; this further implies that Hunag's (1991) Null Epithet Analysis of null objects, whcih suggests that the Chinese null object is the null counterpart of epithets subject to Binding Condition C, is inadequate. Second, the patterns observed may indicate that there are at least three types of antilogophrs in Chinese; these are not independent of each other but represent different degrees of directness in which antilogophoric attitutdes manifest themselves.},

The interpretation of the Japanese comparison construction is determined to a larger extent by pragmatic strategies, as opposed to compositional semantics. The syntactically provided item of comparsion (the constituent accompaying \emph{yori}) does not, in contrast to an English \emph{than}-clause, have a degree semantics; it ultimately contributes an individual. From this item the real comparison has to be inferred. We argue that Japanese does not have English-style degree operators and probably lacks abstraction over degree variables in the syntax altogether. The proposed analysis accounts for a number of empirical differences between Japanese and English. A more general outcome is that the semantics of comparison is subject to crosslinguistic variation. A parameter of language variation is suggested as the source of the differences we observe.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we argue for a syntactic approach to the computation of stress in Spanish. Our basic claim is that stress placement in this language makes crucial reference to the internal syntactic structure of words. In particular, we propose that foot foundaries are projected from certain functional heads. The analysis is set within the framework of Distributed Morphology and uses the formalism of the bracketed grid for the representation of stress. Several hypothese concerning the syntax of words are argued to be necessary in gaining a better understanding of stress placement in Spanish.},

We further show how these shortcomings are avoided by the lexicalist analysis proposed by Hankamer and Mikkelsen (2002) and compare it with an alternative DM analysis that does not rely on head movement in the syntax.

The analysis of a broad range of constructions (quirky subjects, expletive subjects, object shift, scrambling, particle constructions, V-clustering) provides the empirical basis for the following claim: the headedness difference (OV vs. VO) is the basic and crucial factor for the systematic difference between the respective grammars. As for the theoretic modeling of the OV/VO property, the key concept is argued to be a universal constraint on the direction of merger interacting with the directionality of licensing by the head.},

Firs, I review some of the main properties of resultative construcions that appear to motivate the syntactic approach, whose main descriptive tenet is the DOR. In particular, I show that the present analysis of the conflation process involved in the formation of complex resultatives allows us to offer an adequate explanation of their syntactic properties. Second, I put forward a relational syntactic analysis of the so-called `\emph{way}-construction'. In particular, I show that the present analysis helps us understand why the DOR holds for this idiomatic resultative-like construction as well. Finally, I deal with some exceptional cases put forward by Verspoor (1997) and Wechsler (1997), reviewed by Rappaport Hovav and Levin (2001), which appear to contradict the DOR.},

@article{Vikner:2005,
	Abstract = {Certain complex verbs in Dutch, German, and Swiss German do not undergo verb movement. The suggestion to be made in this article is that these ``immobile'' verbs have to fulfill both the requiremetns imposed on complex verbs of the V type (=verbs with non-separable prefixes) and the requirements imposed on complex verbs of the V* ytpe (=verbs with spearable prefixes). This results in such verbs being morphologically unexceptional, 9.e., having a full set of forms but syntactically peculiar (``immobile''), i.e., they can only occur in their base position. Any movement is incompatible with either the V requiremetns or the V* requirements.
Haider (1993, p. 62) and Koopman (1995), who also discuss such immobile verbs, only account for verbs with two prefix-like parts (e.g., German \emph{urauff\"uhren} ('to perform (a play) for the first time' or Dutch \emph{herinvoeren} `to introduce'), not for the more frequent type with only one prefix-like part (e.g., German \emph{bauchreden}/Dutch \emph{buikspreken} `to ventriloquize').
This analysis will try to account not only for the data discussed in Haider (1993) and Koopman (1995) but also for the following:
-why immobile verbs include verbs with only one prefix-like part (and why this single prefix-like part may NOT be a particle),
-why immobile verbs even include verbs with two prefix-like parts, where each of these are separable particles (as in, e.g., German \emph{voranmelden} `preregister'),
-why there is such a great amount of speaker variation as to which verbs are immobile,
-why such verbs are not found in Germanic VO-languages such as English and Scandinavian.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present data from three Norwegian dialect types, NOR-1, NOR-2 and NOR-3, which differ with respect to the verb second (V2) requirement in wh-questions: NOR-1 (represented by Standard Norwegian) requires V2 in all main clauses, NOR-3 (represented by the Nordm\ore dialect) lacks this requirement in all wh-questions, while NOR-2 (represented by the Troms\o dialect) lacks the requirement in questions with a short wh-word. Focusing on NOR-2, we will show that the choice of word order (V2 or V3) is dependent on the information status of the subject. We will argue that this can be related to the position subjects have in the IP domain, more specifically that given subjects occur in Spec-AgrSP and new information subjects occur in Spec-TP. Furthermore, based on the split-CP analysis we will account for the word order differences in the three Norwegian dialect types by postulating a parameterized requirement for filling different C heads. The analysis proposed will also account for why the complementizer \emph{som} is inserted in NOR-2 and NOR-3 whenever the wh-constituent is the subject of the clause. In addition, on the basis of a comparison with Norwegian we will provide analysis of the English subject/oblique asymmetry in wh-questions, i.e., of the fact that there is no auxiliary inversion/do-support in main clause subject wh-questions.},

	Abstract = {This paper provides an analysis of articles in two unrelated languages: St'at'imcets and English child language. The article system in these two languages display striking parallels, divergin in similar ways from that of English adult langauge. Our analysis involves a parametric difference between English and St'at'imcets. While in English adult language, article distinctions rely on the state of the common ground between speaker and hearer, in St'at'imcets they rely on speaker beliefs. Despite the similarites between the patterns of article use in St'at'imcets and child English, we propose that English-acquiring children set the parameter correctly for the English value very early, but that they initially lack a pragmatic conept requireing them to distinguish systematically between their own beliefs and the belief state of their interlocutor. Thsi neutralizes the distinction between the two parameter values, causing the article system of English-speaking children to optionally resemble that of St'at'imcets adults. In terms of language acquisition theory, our study supports a revised version of the Strong Continuity Hypothesis, according to which children obey all principles of Universal Grammar and set parameters as soon as the relevant input is available. Any structures deviating from target language structures result from an immature pragmatic system.},

@article{Pancheva:2005,
	Abstract = {Historical accounts of the phenomenon of cliticization have previously documented only the loss of second-position clitics. This paper argues that the history of Bulgarian offers evidence for the rise of a second-position clitic system. It is demonstrated that the second-position clitics of Old Bulgarian were not directly inherited from Indo-European, but emerged from a system of post-verbal clitics. The findings provide evidence against the position that independent historical laws govern `natural' directions of langauge change. In particular, they challenge the belief in the uniform tendency for clitics to develop into inflectional affixes. Instead, the findings suggest that language change reflects competition between grammatical options, which instantiate principles and parameters of UG based on the properties of the learning algorithm and the nature of the linguistic input, and which are not intrinically ranked. An analysis of the historical change that led to the development of second-position clitics in Old Bulgarian is proposed that implicates a switch in the parameter of headedness of TP. Clitics in both the old and new grammars are attracted by T. A change in the position of T relative to its complement triggers the reanalysis of clitics from pronominals forming a complex head with V to pronominals moving to the left edge of TP. The non-branching status of clitics makes them category-ambiguous (D/DP), which allows them to merge in the syntactic structure as either heads or maximal projections. The paper also traces the eventual loss of the second-position clitic system in Bulgarian and argues that changes in the grammar of phrasal movement, specifically the loss of topicalization to Spec,TP, trigger the syntactic reanalysis of clitics from arguemtns moved and adjoined to TP, into adjuncts to functional heads in the extended projection of V, resulting in the modern pre-verbal clitic system.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an alternative to earlier views of Semitic morphology. Data from Modern Hebrew exemplify that output-based prosodic restrictions form the basis of the unusual root-and-pattern behavior generally attributed to Semitic morphology. Rather than relying on idiosyncratic elements such as the consonantal root, this paper argues that universal constraints demanding that prosodic structures meet both minimality and maximality requirements explain the range of prosodic markedness effects observed in Semitic languages. As a further consequence of this approach, constraints on the realization of affixal material are motivated, explaining root-and-pattern morphology as melodic over-writing without recourse to the consonantal root. As a result, Semitic morphology can be viewed as arising from a language-particular combination of cross-linguistic and universal constraints.},

	Abstract = {The \emph{particle verb construction} (PVC), also referred to in the literature as \emph{phrasal verbs} or \emph{separable complex verb}, occurs in most if not all of the Germanic languages. The work presented here deals with a comparison of the transitive PVC in English and German. In English, the construction occurs in two alternating word orders (\emph{They called off the concert} vs. \emph{They called the concert off}). In German, on the other hand, only one order is possible (\emph{Sie sagten das Konzert ab} vs. \emph{*She sagten ab das Konzert; *Se absagten das Konsert}). The central question is why this kind of word order alternation is possible in a language with otherwise relatively strict word order, such as English, but not in a related langauge such as German, which is otherwise freer in its constituent ordering, allowing, e.g., for scrambling. In this article, the pattern is explained in terms of (the raking of) violable universal constraints from different modules of grammar. I introduce a PVC-related syntactic constraint which punsihes particle pied-piping. I argue that it is the rank of this constraint with respect to a nmber of prosodic constraints that is responsible for the variation between English and German.},

	Abstract = {C agrees in the phi-features of an operator in its Spec but not one \emph{in situ} in many Bantu languages. Despite this I argue that a closest c-command based account (Chomsky 2000) is superior to a Spec-head agreement analysis, for two reasons. First, feature-valuation under closest c-command permits a unified treatment of Bantu operator agreement and West Germanic complementizer agreement with subjects. Second, it explains a common requirement that subjects by \emph{in situ} in Bantu A'-movement constructions: a subject raised to Spec, TP would intervene between C's phi-features and the operator in outer Spec, vP that must value them. Like wh-movement, subject raising always coincides with agreement in Bantu; I propose that Bantu uninterpretable phi-features hapve EPP features. These are distinct from the classical EPP of T which, I argue, underlies a verbal agreement requirement giving every Bantu inflectional category a specifier. I show that nominative Case-checking is independent of both agreement and EPP in Bantu.},

	Abstract = {Extraposed relative clauses pose certain problems for movement-based analyses. They seem to be insensitive to island constraints, and show intricate interactions with variable binding. Starting from the assumption that complement and modifier extraposition should not be treated alike, I present an analysis of relative clause extraposition that does not rely on movement. Instead, I assume that the same syntactic and semantic constraints interact to determine the grammaticality of both extraposed and non-extraposed relative clauses. Syntactically, the proposed constraints lead to the configurational superiority of the relative clause. This superiority has its origin in the semantics of the relative clause: the relative pronoun is referentially defective and remedies this deficiency by selecting an appropriate antecedent. The present analysis draws on data from German.},

Its interaction bewteen linear order and scope has not been described in detail in the previous literature and its complexity makes it particularly relevant to discussions of the similarity of syntactic and semantic structures. It is argued that Thai presents challenges to some hypotheses about the interface between the syntax and semantics of semantic modifiers, in particular, Cinque's (1999) hypothesis that the semantic structures of modifiers are isomorphic to the syntactic structures that express them, as well as Kayne's (1994) Linear Correspondence Axiom. The syntax of aspect in Thai suggests that syntactic and semantic structures are independent levels of representation that are not mapped uniformly onto each other and that a functional category's lexical entry must record both its part of speech and its combinatorial potential.},

@article{Pearson:2005,
	Abstract = {As in other Philippine-type languages, clauses in Malagasy contain a structurally and referentially prominent DP constituent, the trigger, whose grammatical function is indicated by voice morphology on the verb. The trigger shares functional properties with both subjects and topics in other languages. In the Principles and Parameters literature, most researchers identify the trigger as a structural subject, located in the position where nominative case is checked. In this paper, I present evidence that the trigger occupies an A'-position comparable to that of topics in verb-second languages such as Icelandic. I also consider some of the consequences of this analysis: I suggest that voice morphology in Malagasy, rather than marking relation-changing operations like passive, (indirectly) encodes the abstract case features of the A'-chain linked to the trigger, making it akin to Wh-Agreement in Chamorro. In addition, I argue for a non-traditional treatment of the well-known A'-extraction restricitons in Malagasy, usually captured by means of language-specific constraint prohibiting extraction of non-subjects. Treating the trigger as a topic rather than a subject, I propose that wh-movement competes with topicalization for the same A'-position (as in verb-second langauges), rendering the two operations mutually exclusive within a clause.},

	Abstract = {It has been claimed widely that in Indonesian the most frequent type of relative clause, that formed with the complementizer yang and with a gap in place of the relativized NP, is restricted to subject relativization. We challenge this claim and argue that complementizer/gap direct object relativization is also well formed. Furthermore, we argue against the proposal that the grammar of Indonesian contains a stipulation that complementizer/gap relativization is restricted to subjects and direct objects. Rather, the appearance of constraints which conform to the Accessibility Hierarchy of Keenan and Comrie [Linguist. Inquiry 8 (1977) 63] is due to the interaction of ECP-like restrictions on extraction with the structure of various clause types in Indonesian. Specifically, Indonesian exhibits a VP shell structure along the lines of Larson [Linguist. Inquiry 19 (1988) 335], which predicts the extraction facts. While the resulting distribution appears to conform to the Accessibility Hierarchy, there does not appear to be any motivation on the basis of the facts of Indonesian to attribute to the Accessibility Hierarchy an independent role in the grammar. Rather, the appearance of conformity to the Accessibility Hierarchy is epiphenomenal.},

The distribution patterns of the functions of wa (contrastive or not) and ga (exhaustive listing or not) in independent as well as embedded clauses are described as manifestations of the distinction between judgments and propositions. Contrastive reading concerns propositions while exhaustive listing reading is a matter of judgments. The claim that wa sentences express categorical judgments and nonwa sentences, whether with a SL or IL predicate, express descriptions (thetic judgments in the extended sense) is elaborated. This extension is justified on the ground that a cognitive act expressed by a non-wa sentence is affirming, as opposed to asserting, an act expressed by a categorical judgment. Finally, it is claimed that the maximality constraint imposed on descriptions accounts for the exhaustive listing implicature associated with ga.},

A review of a previous, purely phonological account of the data is followed by a discussion on the need to address the phonetic origins of change, and a proposed means for doing so within the Optimality Theoretic framework. Some of the ideas put forth challenge notions central to Optimality Theory (OT), as well as the theory of Lexical Phonology (LP), but it is shown that the development of an explanatory constraint-based theory of phonological change that integrates key insights of the two theories is both possible and desirable.},

Within Optimality Theory, this restriction is explained by aLocal Conjunction that controls vowel deletion as well as the alignment between the main foot and the head of the lexical word, which is irrelevant for the evaluation of outputs containing a diphthong, and therefore allows, in the latter case, the unmarked structure to emerge.},

	Abstract = {Twocase studies are presented of two monolingual Spanish children (ages 1;5 to 2;2 and 1;3 to 2;3) focusing on the acquisition of syllable final consonants, here analyzed as codas. On the basis of target Spanish it is predicted that word final codas should be acquired before word medial codas, because the former are often coronal, i.e., unspecified for Place, and the latter are linked to the following onset, which involves some representational complexity. Moreover, if morphological factors play an important role in early acquisition, final codas, corresponding to plurals and to verbal endings, should be favored over medial codas. The results instead show a clear preference for medial over final codas. Codas of function words, i.e., articles, are favored as well. The analysis shows that these results are due to the prosodic and rhythmic structure of the language and relates syllable development to prosodic and rhythmic development as well as to the development of function words. The preferred foot in adult as well as in early Spanish is the trochee, and many of the function words receive a secondary stress. It is thus argued that a stressed syllable, being the head of a foot, licenses codas in early acquisition. For the two children presented here, prosody paves the way to morphology.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses wh-questions in child European Portuguese and provides evidence that at an early stage of language development (from 1;10.4) at least one category of the complementizer field is projected in the child grammar. It is proposed, assuming the split-CP hypothesis (cf. Rizzi 1997), that this category is Wh, an operator head whose specifier hosts wh-phrases. In addition, it is argued that V-raising to the CP domain is an operation not available to the child, even if the adult system displays this possibility. Evidence from the spontaneous speech production of three Portuguese children supports our hypothesis that the CP domain is active in the child grammar through XP movement and not through the movement of the verb. Finally, it will be shown that focalized {\'e} que-wh-questions is the sole strategy used by the referred children to form constituent interrogatives. The hypothesis is that this follows naturally from a preference for Merge over Move (cf. Chomsky 1995).},

	Abstract = {A unified analysis of three Romanian vowel alternations is proposed in this paper. The alternations occur between mid and low vowels adn between midvowels and diphthongs in stressed position. Diphthongization is treated as vowel lowering under stress. Departing from previous analyses, all three alternations are shown to be part of the same process, both phonologically and morphologically conditioned. The surface distribution of vowels and diphthongs falls out from the interaction of two conflicting forces acting on the stressed vowel of the seem: the pressure on the vowel to lower under stress, and the pressure to rise in a metaphony process conditioned by the vowel of an inflectional suffix. The analysis relies on the interaction of markedness and faithfulness constraints. The latter include a constraint responsible for metaphony, defined as an instance of faithfulness between the vowel of the stem and that of the suffix. Besides allowing a unified treatment of all three alterantions, this analysis also reveals the typological relation of Romanian to other languages whose stress systems are sensitive to vowel height. The morphological distribution of vowels and diphthongs is accounted for by morphologically specific instantiations of constraints outranking the general, phonological ones.},

Specifically, as the ratio of consonant lengthening is the s-aspirated versus non-aspirated contexts grows, the degree of vowel lengthening decreases. In addition, I argue that the data call attention to the limitations of traditional phonological representations. Focusing ont the reltionship between consonant and vowel lengthening, I show that the traditional moraic structure does not adquately characterize this relationship. By contrast, I argue that a gestural model affords a more explicit, thought still abstract, characterization of the data.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the semantics of definite and indefinite generic expressions in Brazilian Portuguese (BP) -- singular and plural definite generics, generic indefinites, bare numberless and bare plurals. It also addresses the differences among the interpretations of the three indefinite generic nominals. The background assumptions are: (i) natural languages make use of both kind-referring expressions and generic quantification to express genericity (see Krifka et al. (1995)); (ii) indefinites are variables (see Heim (1982)). I show that in BP singular and plural definite generics are kind-referring expressions, whereas indefinite generics are heimian indefinites participating on generic quantification.
  The apper claims that common nouns in BP are number-neutral. They denote both atomic an dplural individuals. To account for the fact that number morphology has semantic import in BP, I argue that number morphemes are operators on noun phrase denotations in this language. When the SING(ular) operator applies to a NP, the result is a set of atomic individuals. When the PL(ural) operator applies to a NP, its denotation is stripped of its atomic entities. The different interpretations of indefinites arise through the interaction of the denotation of common nouns, the semantics of number operators and generic quantification.},

The analysis incorporates key ideas behind Safir and Stowell's (1988) seminal paper but avoids the complications that this approach entials. Our propopsal provides one more empirical argument for movement into theta-position, sideward movement, the primacy of movement over binding in matters of construal, and the virtues of a very derivational view of syntax. It is also consistent with a framework that dispneses with LF movement entirely.},

	Abstract = {The interaction among pragmatics, semantics, and grammar and their shared responsibility for interpretation are essential factors in linguistic analysis. This paper explores the interpretation of null objects (NOs) in French from this perspective. Previous accounts have determined two major classes based on the referentiality of the NO; however, these analyses end up, paradoxically, with a semantically vague description of the difference, resorting to undefined notions of identifiability, topic/focus, or probably reference. Starting from the assumption that all NOs are syntactically represented, we tease apart the contributions of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, which turn out to be simple and straightforward. We propose a typology comprising two syntactic types of NO; further nuances are a function of the varying contributions of verbal semantics and pragmatics.},

First, it provides a solution to an important and particularly rcalcitrant problem regarding non-control infinitival complements of derived nouns, which have been argued to provide independent motivation for the retention of the EPP in T. Second, it presents an unnoted problem regarding the elimination of the EPP in infinitival complements of underived nouns, proposing an analysis for them that need not appeal to the EPP in T. To reach these goals, this paper appeals to: (i) an approach to null complementizers as affixes that require specific kinds of hosts, as proposed in Boskovic and Lasnik 2003 (building on, but modifying certain aspects of the foundational analysis in Pesetsky 1991 and Stowell 1981); and (ii) an argument (based on Ormazabal 1995) that non-control infinitival complements to nouns are CPs headed by an affixal null C.},

This was argued by Grodzinky and Reinhart (1993) to support Reinhart's (1983) theory according to which Principle B affects only bound pronouns. Since then, other studies have supported the asymmetry between referential and quantifier antecedents. This article, however, argues that previously unremarked experimental factors lessen the force of all these studies, and it points to other relevant experiments that seem to show that children do not obey Principle B at all. It reviews previously offered theories on the acquisition of Principle B that are compatible with the latter view of the facts.},

The significant empirical coverage of this parameter supports the view that the lexicon must be an active component of the grammar. The discussion focuses mainly on the formation of reflexive verbs. We argue that the prevailing view that reflexive verbs have an unaccusative derivation cannot be maintained. Rather, the reflexivization operation bundles a theta-role with an external theta-role, forming a combination that must merge externally. Next, we also briefly review other arity operations: (a) reciprocalization, (b) decausativization, and (c) saturation, which is involved in the formation of passives, middles, and impersonals. Variation in auxiliary selection, owing to the application of reflexivization or other arity operations, is independent of hte lexicon-syntax parameter and follows under our approach from a structural accusative Case parameter.},
